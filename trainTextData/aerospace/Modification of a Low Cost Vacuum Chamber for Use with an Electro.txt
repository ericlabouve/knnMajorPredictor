Modification of a Low Cost Vacuum Chamber for Use with an
Electromagnetic Railgun
Jason M. Bertels1
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA, 93407

This report details the design and manufacture of modifications to a low cost vacuum
chamber intended for railgun operations. These modifications intend to increase the
functionality of the chamber and enable the modeling of high velocity impacts in a space.
The original vacuum chamber was constructed primarily from polyvinyl chloride to meet
the low cost design constraints, which limits pressures obtainable to the low vacuum region
(760 Torr to 2 Torr). Modifications include construction of a space-saving storage rack,
replacement of external door supports, installation of an internal guide rail, and installation
of electrical feedthroughs.

I. Introduction

ACUUM chambers enable astronautical engineers to physically model the space environment in a laboratory
setting. Micrometeorite impacts in space are a major concern for those who operate and design spacecraft. The
ability to test high velocity impacts in an approximated space environment offers a chance to predict the damage
micrometeorite and space debris collisions inflict on spacecraft. Also, a vacuum environment exerts less
aerodynamic drag on a projectile used for modeling micrometeorite impacts. This report describes a project which
aims to install and operate a railgun in an existing vacuum chamber to perform such testing.
Previous work was undertaken by Andrew W. Bothwell and David J. Foster in 2012. 1 They designed and
created the vacuum chamber that was modified as described in this paper. Their report states that operating a railgun
in a vacuum chamber is appealing because it could decrease the presence of projectile-obscuring plasma discharge
during firing and decrease the friction the projectile would experience in flight.
The railgun project is expanding with the receipt of equipment from the Naval Post Graduate School (NPGS) in
Monterey, CA. The equipment includes very powerful pulsed power sources. Circuitry capable of carrying high
current and high voltages is required to fully utilize the capabilities of these capacitor banks. Also, they create large
electromagnetic pulses when they operate, increasing shielding requirements for the data acquisition system and
other laboratory equipment.

Several goals drove the design of the modifications done to the vacuum chamber. First, the vacuum chamber
needed to support the railgun hardware in the laboratory to efficiently use the available space. Additionally, the
vacuum chamber needed to accommodate the experimental testing equipment being loaded into and out of the
chamber. Finally, the system needed to support the transmission of data and command signals to and from the
testing equipment, as well as the power needed for illumination, equipment operations, and, most significantly,
railgun operation. Previous work suggests that the Mk. 2 railgun might operate at up to 9000V with a peak current of
120kA. 2 The peak power in this situation might exceed 1000 megawatts, though only for a few microseconds. The
power feedthroughs must support both the required electrical current and resist the forces created by the flow of
current through induced magnetic fields. All components that will become part of the pressure shell of the chamber
have special manufacturing requirements, such as air pocket elimination and leak testing.4, 5

II. Initial Vacuum Chamber
The vacuum chamber was created from schedule 80 pipe made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) attached to a
schedule 80 PVC wye bell fitting. The overall length of the interior of the pipe was 161.5 inches (13 feet 5.5 inches)
the interior of the main chamber of the vacuum chamber was roughly a circle with a diameter of 241.3 millimeters
(9.5 inches), though it had deformed over time into an ellipse with a horizontal major diameter and a vertical minor
diameter. These differed by less than 0.5 inches. The external diameter was 10.75 inches. One inch thick Plexiglas
was used at each of the three entrances to create transparent doors.
The chamber was reported to achieve an
internal pressure of 50 Torr.1
The vacuum chamber was not able to support
testing of a railgun due to its lack of hardware.
Figure 1 shows a picture of the chamber before
modifications. The aluminum blocks that secure
the transparent acrylic end plates were not all
adhered to the chamber. Some had broken free of
the epoxy adhesive used to connect them to the
exterior of the vacuum chamber. Reseach
suggests that the cause of failure of the epoxyaluminum bond was oxidization of the aluminum.
This could be cause by water permeating the

the bond over time. Students participating in the
railgun project at Cal Poly have little access to
surface preparations that could prevent this, such as sulfuric acid-dichromate etch and phosphoric acid anodizing.3

III. Design
The improvements to the vacuum chamber were designed to maximize the usability of the vacuum chamber.
Some designs are detailed in technical drawings in Appendix A.

A. Space-Saving Support Rack Design
The main requirements for the rack that supports the vacuum chamber are shown in Table 1. One inch square
steel tubing with a thickness of 0.120 inches was selected for most of the rack. To increase the bending stiffness of
the table, the long horizontal portions were selected to be 1 inch by 3 inches rectangular steel tubing of the same

thickness. MIG welding was chosen for joining the tubes because of the speed and ease it affords. Steel plates four
inches wide and 0.375 inches thick was used to attach the casters to the rack. The casters were cannibalized from
decommissioned equipment from another laboratory in the Aerospace Engineering Department.
1. Rack capacity
The equipment the rack needs to accomadate has known dimensions. Figure 2 shows these dimensions. It was
determined that storing these items under the rack with the vacuum chamber supported on top of the rack allowed
the most efficient use of libratory space.

Compulsator

Capacitor Bank

Figure 2.. The support rack must accommodate the capacitor bank and the compulsator under the chamber. The
dimensions for these pieces of equipment are shown.

To accommodate this equipment, the rack was
designed to fit over a 58 inch tall obstacle, and to
increase the usefulness of the space, the rack can
accommodate obstacles of this height along a full
11 feet of its length. These criteria drove the
length of the rack to 14 feet.

performed to determine the limits for tipping the
rack. The geometry is shown in Figure 4. From
this analysis, the following relationships are

B. Guide Rail
The guide rail design aims to enable quick and easy loading of experimental equipment into and out of the
vacuum chamber. Strength, ease of use, ease of installation, and maximizing the usable space in the vacuum
chamber were top considerations during the design process.
3. Early Design
Several early concepts focused on extremely slim
guide rails. Figure 6 shows one such concept,
proposed by previous work.1 As the designed
matured, the tradeoff between slimness and ease of
manufacturing became apparent, and the height of
the design increased to 1.94 inches, or 2.
2.44 inches if
the proposed carriage board is used.
Adhesives are a logical choice for fixing the
guide rail to the chamber interior. This design
ensures the adhesive will be adequately strong by
providing a surface area for bonding with the vacuum
chamber interior.
To increase the ease of use, a method for securing
the experimental apparatus in place is provided by
this design.

Figure 8 provides additional depictions of the design.
The carriages are much narrower than the equipment the vacuum chamber is intended to support. A carriage
board provides a wider surface to interface
terface with the experimental equipment. Figure 10 shows a proposal for such a
carriage board. Clearance holes for M5 screws (to interface with the DryLin carriages) and ½” UNC screws (to
interface with the experimental equipment) span the length of the board. This design proposes a 36” long board, but
the board is easily scaled to other lengths. The board is 7” wide, which provides a mounting surface that nearly
spans the width of the chamber.

Material
aterial selection favored materials that had low
outgassing properties. The construction
ruction of the vacuum
chamber from PVC limits the pumpdown performance due to
its higher gas load when compared to metals like 304 or 316
stainless steel. Because of this, some precautions usually
taken when designing a high vacuum and ultra high vacuum
were
re unnecessary, such as the exclusion of plastics like PVC
from the chamber. In addition, some anodized aluminum was
used in entrance hinge,, which would have been unacceptable
in a high vacuum system.
The materials used also were selected for their low
magnetic permeability due to the high electromagnetic pulse
that the railgun creates when fired. Aluminum and aaustenitic
stainless steels (like 304 and 316) were used, while fferritic
and martensitic stainless steels were excluded.
4. Final Design
Many componets of the early design were unchanged in
the final design, like the selection
ection of the DryLin guide rails
and carriages. Others were refined and revised to increase
manufacturability and ease of use of the design.
The PVC mounting blocks were designed to lengths
ranging from 12 to 18 inches. At this size, the blocks are

interfaces with both the DryLin carriages and the

sufficiently long to accurately align the rails
as well as short enough to be machined in the
Haas TM-1 CNC mill in the hangar at Cal
Poly. Figure 12 shows one of the designed
PVC mounting blocks. Appendix A contains
techical drawings of these blocks.
A hingee provides an easy means to secure
the carriageboards and their payloads in place
during testing. Figure 14 shows how the
hinge looks assembled. The hinge door is
held in place by a removable aluminum rod
that is held in place by two hooks. The hooks
are connected to the PVC mounting blocks
using 2 inch long aluminum standoffs.
Because of the large magnetic flux that this
hookplate-standoff
standoff circuit would experience
during railgun operations, these componets
are insulated from one another with five
layers of Kapton tape
ape (or an equally
insulative barrier) and joined using insulating
polycarbonate machine screws.

Figure 12.. The 18 inch long PVC guide rail mounting block
depicted here joins the ends of adjacent DryLin guide rails. The
Haas TM-1

single mill setup and operation, enabling high precision and
accuracy to be more easily achieved.

Figure 14.. The hinged door provides an easy way to secure the equipment into the chamber. Constructed primarily from PVC
and aluminum, it features a ¼-20

aluminum block at the target end of the chamber.

The hinge door has a threaded hole aligned with the hardware
connected to the carriage. This hole accepts a ¼

C. Power Delivery Feedthroughs
Tremendous amounts of energy are delivered to the railgun
during operation. The vacuum chamber needs to provide a means
to deliver this power to the gun. High current capacity electrical

conductors are employed in this design to accomplish this power
delivery requirement.
Previous work suggested that an aluminum rod, sealed to the
vacuum chamber with epoxy, would deliver power to the railgun
in the vacuum chamber. Figure 15 shows this design. There is
much room for improvement for this design.

this design holds pressure, using a test where a .5 inch diameter

epoxy. Two processes for bonding aluminum are accepted and
used in the aircraft industry: FPL etch (sulfuric acid

etch), and Phosphoric acid anodizing (PAA). Both processes are
improved by applying a CIAP (corrosion inhibiting adhesive
primer). However, neither is intended for PVC

and both require expensive equipment.

IV. Testing
A. Rail support PVC block CAM testing
The PVC blocks used to support the DryLin “T” guide rails were manufactured from a 2 inches by 1 inch by 48
inches rectangular stock of PVC. Three inch long prototype segments were created using the Cal Poly Aerospace
Engineering Department’s Haas TM-11 CNC mill. Figure 19 shows the
he prototype during and after milling. Appendix
C shows the G-code
code used in this operation.

B. Outgassing testing
An outgassing test was used to
determine the feasibility of using
epoxy or PVC cement in the vacuum
chamber. These tests were performed
in the Space Environments lab at
California

11 and 12, 2013, using the “Student

3113-VHX. The pump was a Welch
Duo-Seal Vacuum Pump with a model
number
1397.
The
pressure
measurement sensor was made by Gainesville Phillips, model 316.
Five pump-down tests were undertaken. The first test collected pressure data for the chamber with only a plastic
outgassing shield inside. This shield was used in every test to prevent the samples from depositing outgassed
contaminants on the surfaces of the vacuum chamber. This shield was made from this sheets of acrylic adhered
together to form a box roughly 12 inches tall by 6 inches by 6 inches.
The second test, performed shortly after the first test, collected pressure data as the vacuum chamber was
pumped down with the outgassing shield and a sample of the PVC pipe and a 3 inches long prototype of the PVC
mounting blocks. No adhesive was used.
The third test was performed the next day, and again only the outgassing shield was present in the chamber.
The fourth and fifth test were performed shortly after the third, and contained a PVC mounting block prototype
adhered to the PVC pipe samples with PVC cement and epoxy, respectively.
Figure 20 shows the samples that were prepared for the vacuum chamber.
Figure 21 shows the data taken during this test. This outgassing test showed that for pump-down times of less
than one hour, the outgassing of the samples was less significant than that of the overall chamber. Water monolayer
vaporization and other large gas loads dominated the data taken during these test. 4, 5 Longer tests may have yielded
more insight into the impact these materials will have on the vacuum chamber’s performance.

Figure 20. Four samples were prepared for the outgassing test, though only three were tested in the Student Vacuum
Chamber 1 vacuum chamber. Sample 1 has no adhesive, sample 2 used PVC adhesive, sample 3 uses epoxy, and sample 4
uses the same epoxy, but the epoxy was allowed to rest for 20 minutes before application. No loss in strength was evident
from the delayed mating. The remaining epoxy hardened at the 50 minute mark.

VI. Future Work
The support rack needs to be augmented by a superstructure that secures the chamber to the rack safely and
stiffens the top of the metal rack,, as it was deemed too flexible once the chamber was loaded onto it.
At the time this report was written, the PVC components for the rail and the aluminum hinge had not been
manufactured yet. Machinists at the Cal Poly machine shops were hired to produce the components. When these
parts are complete, the guide
uide rail needs to be installed. A procedure for this installation can be found in Appendix B.
The feedthroughs need to be manufactured and installed. Feedthroughs for data signals need to be designed,
manufactured, and installed. The target end of the vacuum chamber is a prime location for these feedthroughs.

VII. Conclusion
This report discussed modifications to an existing low cost vacuum chamber to enable it to support the operation
of an electromagnetic railgun. The vacuum chamber was constructed 10 inch schedule 80 PVC pipe by Andrew
Bothwell and David Foster. The modifications continue where they left off, and additional modification will be
required to realize the goal of modeling impacts in an artificial space environment.
An early goal for the previous work done on this project constrained the cost of the chamber to $500. During the
development of the chamber, this was determined to be far too restrictive. A looser constraint of $2000 was set, and
the final cost for the bare-bones chamber came to be $1325.
The additional costs incurred during the work detailed in this report amounts to $941.49. These costs are detailed
in Appendix D. The original cost constraint was overly optimistic, as the additional purchases bring the total cost to
$2266, which exceeds the cost constraint by 13%.
Additional funding and skilled machinists will be critical to the successful completion of the vacuum chamber.
Once complete, this vacuum chamber will provide Cal Poly students with a test bed for high speed impacts in a low
pressure environment.

October 28, 2013
Intent of Activity
To support the goals of the Cal Poly railgun program, install a guide rail in the Cal Poly railgun vacuum chamber. The
support rail, constructed primarily from PVC and aluminum and installed with epoxy and PVC cement, enables the
loading, unloading, and securing of experimental equipment in the vacuum chamber during railgun operations. The
hardware is 158.75 inches long (4.03 meters).
Materials used/consumed/output during activity
The equipment to be installed will be manufactured in the Cal Poly machine shops. The epoxy will be acquired from the
Cal Poly Thermodynamics & Spacecraft Environments Lab (41B-137), and the PVC cement will be supplied by the
Activity Lead, Jason Bertels.
Facilities Used During Activity
Prop lab
Hardware Used During Activity
The vacuum chamber will need to be accessed during this activity. The assembled hardware will be installed. Levels and
a 1.90inch long spacer block will be used. A staging area near the chamber will be prepared for the epoxy application.
Personal protective equipment, including non-latex gloves, closed toed shoes, long pants, and safety glasses, will be worn
by all team members.

Nominal Behavior During Activity
1. The vacuum chamber will be opened at both ends, and a container of PVC cement will be places within reach of
each end of the chamber, lids loosely resting on the container, so they can be used with one hand.
2. Several levels will be attached to the equipment to be installed. A spacer block 1.90 inches long will be attached
to the hinge end of the hardware to be installed.
3. A 5 minute timer will be started, and the following procedure will be run through without applying the adhesives to
ensure the activity can be completed before the epoxy cures. If this is not successful, additional practice runs can
be attempted. If successful, the team will attempt to slide the carriages down the length of the installation to
ensure proper function and ease of use. Carriages should not stop when they move between rails.
4. If the dry run is successful, the procedure will be repeated, but the primer, epoxy, and PVC cement will be applied
for real.
5. The hardware is constructed from PVC blocks attached to an aluminum rail with bolts, with aluminum ends
capable of compressing the installed equipment to secure it during operation. The PVC blocks on each end will be
pieces will receive PVC cement primer, as will the areas they mate to on the ends of the vacuum chamber.
6. The timer will be reset for 5 minutes and epoxy will be mixed. The epoxy will be applied to all the PVC surfaces
that will mate with the interior of the vacuum chamber, with the exception of the two end pieces. Excess epoxy will
be wiped off to avoid drips in the vacuum chamber.
7. At least two team members will lift the hardware into a position where it can be slid into the vacuum chamber. The
hardware will be inverted, so the epoxy coated curved surfaces face upward. One end will be placed inside the
chamber.
8. While the hardware remains inverted (so the epoxy does not touch the chamber), one team member will slide the
equipment into the chamber until it reaches the other end and another team member can reach it.
9. Both team members will apply PVC cement with one hand while holding the equipment in the air with the other.
10. The rail will be immediately inverted and placed in the bottom of the chamber such that the removable spacer
block aligns with the entrance of the chamber, and the levels show that the equipment is level.
11. The hardware will be held in place for 60 seconds as the PVC cement cures.
12. The levels and spacer block will be removed 10 minutes after the completion of the activity.
13. The vacuum chamber will be closed no sooner than 1 hour after the equipment is installed to allow fumes to
diffuse out of the chamber.

Off-Nominal Behavior During Activity
If epoxy, primer, PVC cement, or any other contaminant makes contact with the aluminum guide rail, the activity will be
halted until the containment is removed.
If the practice installations cannot be completed in less than 5 minutes, the activity has crossed a red line and will be
rescheduled.
If the 5 minute timer goes off before the equipment is installed, the team members should use a rod to check to make sure
the epoxy has not cured. If it has cured, the activity has crossed a red line. The hardware will be removed and the activity
will be rescheduled.
If the equipment is visibly unstable, if the carriages that ride on the rail do not slide easily between rails when equipment is
rested in the chamber after the practice run, or if anything breaks or does not function according to its intended design,
the hardware will be removed, and the activity will be rescheduled.
If the activity is rescheduled, the hardware will be disassembled and stored under the vacuum chamber until another
installation is scheduled.
