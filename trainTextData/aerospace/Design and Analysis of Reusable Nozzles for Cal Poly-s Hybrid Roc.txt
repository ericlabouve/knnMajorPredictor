Two nozzles were designed and constructed for testing in the Cal Poly propulsion
laboratory to explore which nozzle was the most capable in producing the most thrust. A 15
degree and 30 degree converging-diverging nozzles were machined and tested. Theory suggest
that a bell nozzle would be the most efficient since all of the gasses generated in the combustion
chamber are directed and accelerated by the throat leave the nozzle traveling along the thrust
axis. All of the momentum of the gasses are directed axially thus resulting in maximum thrust.
Thrust should also be produced by the converging-diverging nozzle and the hole nozzle since
due to the continuity equation a decreased area should result in an increase in velocity of the
flow. From the experimental tests conducted it was found that the 15 and 30-degree
converging-diverging nozzles resulted in an average of 1.47 and 1.57 lbf of thrust respectively.
The nozzle that produced the most thrust was the 30 degree nozzle.

I. Introduction
YBRID rockets are rocket motor systems that use a solid fuel grain, and the other some type of liquid or gas as an
Hoxidizer. A hybrid rocket uses propellants in two different states of matter - one solid and the other either gas or
liquid. The Hybrid rocket concept can be traced back at least 75 years. Hybrid rockets exhibit advantages over both
liquid rockets and solid rockets especially in terms of simplicity, safety, and cost. Because it is nearly impossible for
the fuel and oxidizer to be mixed intimately (being different states of matter), hybrid rockets tend to fail more benignly
than liquids or solids. Like liquid rockets and unlike solid rockets they can be shut down easily and are simply throttleable. The theoretical specific impulse, Isp, performance of hybrids is generally higher than solids and roughly
equivalent to hydrocarbon-based liquids. Specific Impulses as high as the 400s have been measured in a hybrid rockets
using metalized fuels. Hybrid systems are slightly more complex than solids, but the significant hazards of
manufacturing, shipping and handling solids offset the system simplicity advantages.
In its simplest form a hybrid rocket consists of a pressure vessel (tank) containing the liquid propellant, the
combustion chamber containing the solid propellant, and a valve isolating the two. When thrust is desired, a suitable
ignition source is introduced in the combustion chamber and the valve is opened. The liquid propellant (or gas) flows
into the combustion chamber where it is vaporized and then reacts with the solid propellant. Combustion occurs in a
boundary layer diffusion flame adjacent to the surface of the solid propellant. Generally the liquid propellant is the
oxidizer and the solid propellant is the fuel because solid oxidizers are problematic and lower performing than liquid
oxidizers. Furthermore, using a solid fuel such as HTPB or paraffin allows for the incorporation of high-energy fuel
additives such as aluminum, lithium, or metal hydrides. Common oxidizers include gaseous or liquid oxygen or nitrous
oxide. Common fuels include polymers such as polyethylene, cross-linked rubber such as HTPB or liquefying fuels
such as paraffin.
In order to generate additional thrust from firing hybrid rockets, nozzles are attached to the flow-exiting end
of the fuel grain. These nozzles converge and/or diverge the flow into, through, and out of the nozzle in order to
accelerate the flow and generate more thrust. There are many different shapes and types of nozzles out there, but for
this project we are looking at 3 certain shapes of nozzles: a hole nozzle, a converging-diverging nozzle, and a bell
nozzle. First, the hole nozzle has a conical converging section that will converge to a hole and the flow will exit out
of the hole and expand freely into the atmosphere. This configuration should have the least amount of thrust of the
three nozzle shapes being looked at because the exiting flow expands unbounded and the thrust vector is not kept in
check horizontally. Second, the converging-diverging nozzle has a conical converging section down to the throat and
then a conical diverging section where the flow will expand as much as allowed by the shape of the nozzle. This
configuration should show more thrust than the hole nozzle because the exiting flow is bound and only allowed to
expand at a certain angle, therefore keeping the thrust vector more horizontal out of this nozzle than the hole nozzle.
Finally, the bell nozzle has a conical converging section down to the throat and a bell-shaped diverging section. This
nozzle shape should show the most thrust out of the three configurations because the bell-shaped diverging section
allows the flow to expand, and then corrects the flow expansion angle by redirecting the flow closer to the horizontal
and changing the thrust vector to as close to horizontal out the back of the nozzle as possible.
Another way to analyze which nozzle will provide more thrust is through the static thrust equation:
𝐹 = 𝑚̇𝑉𝑒 + (𝑃𝑒 − 𝑃𝑎𝑚𝑏 )𝐴𝑒 (1)
where T is the thrust, is the mass flow rate, 𝑉𝑒 is the flow exit velocity in the axial direction, 𝑃𝑒 is the pressure at the
exit of the nozzle, 𝑃𝑎𝑚𝑏 is the ambient air pressure, and Ae is the exit area of the nozzle. For all 3 nozzle configurations
we can assume that and 𝑃𝑎𝑚𝑏 are constant, 𝑉𝑒 was discussed previously as well as 𝐴𝑒 , and so the only variable is 𝑃,
the exit pressure. The longer the expanding part of the nozzle is, the more the pressure drops getting closer and closer
to the ambient pressure while assuming supersonic flow. By analyzing Eq. 1, maximum thrust can be achieved when
the exit pressure is equal to the ambient pressure. So a longer expanding nozzle section is ideal. Therefore, the
converging-diverging and bell nozzle will provide more thrust than the hole nozzle because of the expanding section
dropping the pressure closer to ambient as well as the exit area being smallest. Also, the maximum exit velocity the
hole nozzle can have is sonic, whereas the C-D and bell nozzles can go supersonic because of their expanding sections.
The exit velocity in the axial direction for the bell nozzle will be greater than the C-D nozzle because it corrects the
flow direction more than the conical diverging section in the C-D nozzle. Therefore, through analysis of the static

thrust equation we can say that the order of the nozzles from highest to lowest in the amount of thrust provided should
be the hole nozzle, C-D nozzle, then the bell nozzle.

Procedure

A. Apparatus
This experiment is run with Cal Poly’s hybrid rocket setup as seen in Figure 1. The solid fuel for this experiment
was a clear thermoplastic called polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), often used as a lightweight or shatter-resistant
alternative to glass known as Plexiglas. The chemical composition of this material is as shown:
𝐶5 𝑂2 𝐻8
As the oxidizer mixes with the fuel in the combustion process a balanced chemical equation results as followed below:
𝐶5 𝑂2 𝐻8 + 6𝑂2 → 5𝐶𝑂2 + 𝐻2 𝑂

Figure 2. (a) 15 Degree Nozzle (b) 30 Degree Nozzle (c) Hole nozzle

The 15 and 30 degree converging-diverging nozzles had a throat-to-exit ratio of 0.55 and 0.32 respectively as seen in
Figure 2. The hole nozzle was designed to an exit diameter of 0.25 inches with the same inlet diameter as the previous
nozzles.
B. Procedure
Using LABVIEW a load cell was used to record the force data on the test stand as a voltage reading. Oxygen
pressure and chamber pressure was recorded by hand during the run from pressure gauges. The sensor was first
calibrated before the experiment was conducted. This was done by adding 1lb weights for a total weight of 5lbs in
order to obtain a linearized curve to convert voltage readings from the experiment. The voltages from the pressure
transducers were then routed to a National Instrument data acquisition unit, which converts analog voltages to digital
data. The calibration data can be seen in Figure 3. The calibration data show 6 columns of data corresponding to

Figure 3. Calibration data used to create a linear regression line that gave the corresponding
force for a given voltage.

millivolts associated with no load up to five pounds of weight. In order to calculate the trend line hat best reflects the
calibration, the average of all the values for a particular weight reading was calculated. Each of those six points were
used to calculate the line of best fit for the data obtained for three days. The line of best fit was found to be,
𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 = 598.3457 ∗ 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒 − 11.5962
𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 = 550.1235 ∗ 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒 − 11.2861
𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑐𝑒 = 538.0518 ∗ 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑎𝑔𝑒 − 11.0866

Where the force is in lbf and the voltage is in millivolts. Three calibration lines were obtained since all runs were
conducted through the course of three days. In order to acquire voltage readings for each run the load cell was
calibrated for every day a hot fire was tested.
Once calibration data was obtained every fuel grain and nozzle were then measured and recorded. The length
of the fuel grain was measured to be 9.0 in with an inner and outer diameter of 0.496 and 2.07 inches respectively.
The mass of the fuel grain before the experiment was 1.146 lbs. The nozzle dimensions were also measured and are
shown above.
Before running the experiment a leak test was performed in order to make sure that the oxidizer would not leak
out of stand. A fuel grain with no hole drilled through the middle was installed into the test stand where compressed
air was let into the system. The leak test was performed by determining from the sound of air exiting the test stand.
Once the leak test was performed the actual fuel grain was lubricated on both ends and then installed into the test
stand. Once test area was then cleared of combustible and loose material the propane tank was opened up and regulated
to about 25 psig in order to accelerate the ignition process. The oxygen tank was then opened up and regulated to a
pressure of 95 psig. The load cell black was then removed from the test stand and all personnel were cleared from the
test cell. The system was then powered on and armed. The experiment was then run for about 45 second where the
tank pressures and chamber pressures were recorded while the DAQ recorded the voltage readings from the load cell.
The experiment was also conducted using a cold flow test where the hybrid rocket was not ignited. Once the test was
completed the experiment was then redone using a hole nozzle. Finally the apparatus was uninstalled and data was
exported and analyzed in MATLAB. In order to calculate the average regression rate change in area was calculated
through the equation shown below:
∆𝐴 =

∆𝑤

(1)

𝜌𝑓 𝐿

where ∆A is the change in cross-sectional area of the fuel grain core after the burn, ∆w is the change in fuel grain
weight, L is the length of the fuel grain, and ρf is the density of the fuel grain. The initial area was found through the
following equation:
𝜋∗𝐷𝑖2

𝐴𝑖 =

(2)

where Di is the diameter of the fuel grain before firing. The final are is the calculated using the equation below.
𝐴𝑓 = 𝐴𝑖 + ∆𝐴

where Af is the final area and ∆A is the change in cross-sectional area of the fuel grain. The final diameter is
calculated using

𝐷𝑓 = (

The change in diameter is calculated in order to find the average fuel regression rate as shown below.
∆𝑑𝑖𝑎 = 𝐷𝑓 − 𝐷𝑖

(5)

The burn rate or average fuel regression rate was calculated using the following equation:
𝑟=

∆𝑑𝑖𝑎

(6)

𝑡𝑏

where r is the burn rate, ∆𝑑𝑖𝑎 is the change in diameter found from equation (5), and tb is the burn time which is
found by subtracting the final burn time from the initial burn time. The average fuel flow rate was then found using
the following equation:
𝑚̇𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 =

∆𝑤
𝑡𝑏

(7)

where 𝑡𝑏 is the burn time and ∆𝑤 is the change in fuel grain weight. A conversion factor of 32.2 was included in the
weight calculations in order for the fuel flow rate to be in slugs/sec. The average oxygen mass flow rate was then
calculated using

where CD is the sonic nozzle discharge coefficient of 0.94, 𝑃0−𝑂2 is the oxygen pressure upstream from the sonic
nozzle (assumed equal to stagnation pressure or tank pressure), 𝐴𝑡 is the sonic nozzle throat area, γ is the specific
heat ratio of 1.395 at 77˚F, R is the universal gas constant of 48.291 ft-lbf/lbm-R, TO2 is the oxygen stagnation
temperature which is assumed to be equal to ambient air temperature. The mixture ration can then be calculated
using the following equation:
𝑂
𝐹

𝑚̇𝑂𝑋
𝑚̇𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙

(9)

where 𝑚̇𝑂𝑋 and 𝑚̇𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 were calculated from equations (7) and (8). The specific impulse of the rocket is then
calculated with the following equation
𝐼𝑠𝑝 =

(10)

where F is the average thrust.

III. Results
Data was obtained throughout the length of three days for three nozzles. The load cell was calibrated every day
and the following results were obtained. Figure 4 shows the force on the load cell produced by running the experiment
with the oxygen supply at a pressure of 95psig for 45 seconds. The plot on the left shows all the data acquired for the
first day of the 15 degree nozzle. As is seen in the figure, negative data was obtained for the experiment. Since negative

thrust is not valid data and a systematic error, negative thrust point were removed. The values before the ignition
switch was turned on were also removed to obtain an accurate burn time. The points where the load cell registered
more than five pounds were also removed since the load cells is only able to acquire a maximum thrust of five pounds.
Data obtained from the three days was averaged and resulted in an average thrust of 1.47 lbs for the 15 degree nozzle.
Table 1 shows all of the parameters calculated for the 15 degree nozzle using the equations discussed in the previous
section.

As seen in Table 1 the thrust produced for each run does vary by a tenth of a pound. It was noted in conducting
the experiment that there was a minor inconsistency in the throat of the nozzle, which caused an angled exit flow as
seen in the Figure 5. This inconsistency therefore caused the nozzle to not divert its full force axially to the load cell.

Figure 5. 15 Degree Nozzle with an Angled Exit Velocity

The second nozzle used for the experiment was the 30 degree nozzle. The thrust obtained for all of the data is
shown below in Figure 6 and for the reduced data. The average thrust produced for this nozzle resulted in a 6.4%
increase from the 15 degree nozzle with an average thrust of 1.57 lbs.

Figure 6. Thrust of 30 Degree Nozzle for the First Day. Right Plot Shows Reduced Data

The 30 degree nozzle was ran for four runs and all parameters calculated are shown in Table 2. It was also noted that
the thrust throughout the different days varied greatly and could be attributed to the accuracy of the calibration. The
two new nozzles machined for this project, 15-degrees and 30-degrees, are shown in Figure 7, from left to right
respectively.

The third nozzle used for the experiment was the hole nozzle. Unfortunately the hole nozzle designed for this
project was not machined in time therefore a previously used hole nozzle was used instead as a comparison to the
other two nozzles produced. The average thrust produced for this nozzle resulted was an average thrust of 1.46 lbs the
lowest of the three nozzles, which was expected.

Since the hole nozzle was only conducted for three runs the resulting thrust was the lowest but only by 0.01 lbf of
thrust. It did have the most consistent average thrust produced throughout each run. This can be attributed to the fact
that the hole nozzle was conducted in one day whereas the 15 degree and 30 degree nozzles took two days.
Inconsistencies in the thrust produced for the converging-diverging nozzle could be reduced in the future by allocating
one day for just one nozzle.

IV. Conclusion
In this experiment, the thrusts for three different nozzles were observed, and specific impulses were calculated
using the Cal Poly hybrid rocket lab test stand with a five-pound load cell. It was observed that changing to the new
nozzles had a direct impact on increasing thrust. A larger diameter throat allowed for more oxidizer flow while still

converging the flow, which increased the overall thrust. The ratio of inlet to outlet diameter of the new nozzles is
directly related to the maximum exit velocity and thrust achieved. It is important to understand the assumptions,
restrictions and errors of any measuring and calculation method used. Some possible human error could come from
having to set the pressure on the oxidizer tank, which directly effects oxidizer flow rate, each time the nozzles were
fired. Some other error in the data came from spikes in chamber pressure and thrust when some “crud” and pieces of
the solid fuel grain got stuck in the nozzle before being incinerated and the nozzle opened to full flow again. Overall,
the goals of this project were achieved in that new reusable nozzles with higher thrusts were designed and built and
compared to the old nozzle using the LabView DAQ setup in the Cal Poly Propulsion Lab, while exploring hybrid
rocket bell nozzle design.
