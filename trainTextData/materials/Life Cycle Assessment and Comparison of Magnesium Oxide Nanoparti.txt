Abstract
Abstract: Magnesium oxide nanoparticles are being used increasingly as catalysts for organic
synthesis, fuel oil additives, and CO2 adsorbents. There are many ways to produce magnesium
oxide nanoparticles, but there is little information available regarding the environmental costs of
production. As demand for environmentally friendly materials increases, it is important to
understand environmental impact differences between various production methods. This study
will compare the differences in embodied energy and global warming potential (GWP) between
two synthesis methods: microwave combustion synthesis (microwave synthesis) and oxidation of
magnesium hydroxide (aqueous synthesis). The resulting nanoparticles were characterized using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy
dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). Nanoparticles produced through microwave synthesis
formed nanocubes while aqueous synthesis produced round particles with less pronounced
facets. The embodied energy and GWP were determined using life cycle assessment (LCA), and
it was found that the embodied energy and GWP of magnesium oxide nanoparticles produced by
microwave synthesis were significantly less than that of aqueous synthesis.
1. Introduction
Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a readily available material that has numerous applications as an
electrical insulator, thermal insulator, substrate, catalyst1, and CO2 adsorber2. MgO nanoparticles
have greater utility as catalysts than bulk materials or microparticles due to their increased
specific surface area. Applications that rely on high surface area MgO particles include CO2
capture, catalysis of organic reactions, and filtration. MgO nanoparticles are also receiving
attention as a fuel oil additive that increases fuel efficiency, reduces NOx emissions, and reduces
sludge buildup within engines3. Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the earth’s
crust and is currently extracted from salt water.
There are two main approaches to producing MgO nanoparticles: combusting magnesium in
oxygen, and calcining magnesium hydroxide particles. This study looks into one method from
each approach. The first method is to combust magnesium metal in oxygen. This results in the
production of a great amount of heat and light, and produces MgO nanocubes. The particular

1

method in this study has previously been investigated as a way of producing pure, ready-to use
nanocubes4.
The second approach is a chemical synthesis method starting with the formation of magnesium
hydroxide precipitates in an aqueous solution. The magnesium hydroxide is then dried and
oxidized in a furnace5. In this approach, the rate of reaction can be controlled to a much higher
degree by altering the concentration of reactants and oxidation temperature. The particle size of
the resulting MgO nanoparticles is affected by the concentration of the reactants in the aqueous
step.

2. Experimental Procedure
2.1 Microwave Synthesis
In the microwave synthesis method the objective is to vaporize and combust magnesium metal
by arcing steel wool mixed with magnesium to produce a MgO vapor that will condense on a
silica substrate. 30 mg of steel wool was gathered into a ball and placed inside an alumina
crucible. 30 mg of magnesium ribbon was sliced lengthwise to produce thin, wire-like
magnesium ribbons, then placed in the crucible with the steel wool and lightly mixed. The
crucible was then covered by a glass microscope slide and a crucible lid. The crucible, slide, and
lid assembly (Figure 1) were then placed inside a glass bowl within a household 1000 Watt
microwave (Magic Chef model HMD1110B).

wool (A). Filled crucible covered with glass microscope slide and alumina lid (B).

The microwave was set for 1000 Watts and turned on for 30 seconds. The magnesium and steel
wool react in bursts as the material arcs and burns. The material in the crucible has typically
completed reacting before the microwave turns off. After allowing the crucible to cool for 20
minutes, it is removed from the microwave. A clearly visible white MgO powder is deposited on
the microscope slide where it covered the crucible (Figure 2). The mass of the slide with powder
was compared to the mass of the slide before the process to determine the mass of powder
produced, which was 16 milligrams. The slide with MgO particles was then stored in a slide case
for further analysis.

2.2 Aqueous Synthesis
Reactant solutions of magnesium nitrate and sodium hydroxide were prepared such that mixing
equal volumes of solution would result in the stoichiometrically ideal balance of reacting ions.
0.1 M magnesium nitrate solution was prepared by dissolving 1.483 g of magnesium nitrate in
100 mL of deionized water in a 250 mL glass beaker. 0.2 M sodium hydroxide solution was
prepared by dissolving 0.799 g of sodium hydroxide in 100 mL of water. The sodium hydroxide
solution was then mixed into the magnesium nitrate solution under constant stirring on a
magnetic stir plate. The mixture of magnesium nitrate and sodium hydroxide was left on the stir
plate for 2 hours to react. The sodium hydroxide reduced the magnesium nitrate to form
magnesium hydroxide precipitates and sodium nitrate in solution. After 2 hours, stirring was
ceased and the magnesium hydroxide precipitates were allowed to settle at the bottom of the
beaker (Figure 3).

magnesium hydroxide precipitate settles to the bottom of the aqueous solution.

Once settled, the supernatant was removed and ~50 mL of ethanol was added to it in a washing
step. The suspension was then left to settle overnight after which the washing step of removing
the supernatant was removed and adding ~50 mL of ethanol was repeated. After letting the
precipitate settle overnight once again, the supernatant was removed and the suspension was left
uncovered under a laminar flow hood for approximately 8 hours. After approximately half of the
remaining solvent had evaporated, the sample was placed in a Fisher Scientific Isotemp™ Oven
at 110ºC for 12 hours to remove any remaining solvent (Figure 4).

After being removed from the oven, the magnesium hydroxide was transferred from the beaker
to a small alumina crucible for calcination. Calcination of the magnesium hydroxide was carried
out in a Fisher Scientific Isotemp™ Muffle Furnace at 500ºC for 4 hours. The crucible was then
removed and allowed to air cool to room temperature (Figure 5). At this point the process for
producing MgO nanoparticles was complete and the sample was weighed and transferred to a
plastic test tube for later analysis. 0.2601 grams of MgO nanoparticles was produced using this
method.

2.3 Characterization
2.3.1 SEM
To determine the structure of the materials produced, they were first examined using a scanning
electron microscope (SEM). The samples were not sputtered with conductive metal, but left in
their as-synthesized condition. For both microwave and aqueous samples, an adhesive copper
tape was contacted to the powder and placed on an electrically conductive SEM sample holder.
Secondary electron SEM images were taken of the coated surface of the glass slides used in the
microwave process. This method was unable to produce SEM images in which the particle
features were visible, although it did show the presence of small particles, 2 microns in size or
smaller resulting from microwave synthesis (Figure 6).

2.3.2 TEM and EDS
Because of the small size of the nanoparticles being produced and their non-conductive nature,
the samples were imaged using the Philips CM200 transmission electron microscope (TEM) at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. MgO nanoparticles were dusted onto Formvar-coated
copper TEM grids for analysis. Energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDS) was also performed
with this TEM to determine the composition of the produced material.
2.4 Life Cycle Assessment
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a technique used to evaluate the environmental impact of a given
process or product. For products, life cycle assessment generally consists of 5 different phases:
materials, manufacturing, transportation, use, and end of life. LCA usually looks at one or more
impact categories, such as embodied energy, toxicity, and global warming potential (GWP).
GWP is a relative measure of how much of an impact a greenhouse gas has on the environment.
GWP is measured in kilograms of CO2 equivalent produced per kilogram of product. The goal of
this LCA was to find the embodied energy and GWP of the MgO nanoparticles produced via
each of the microwave and aqueous methods. The LCA performed for this project includes the
materials and processes (manufacturing) used to produce the MgO nanoparticles. This LCA does
not explore the transportation, use, or end of life of the MgO nanoparticles. This LCA also does
not include the embodied energy or GWP of the stir plate, microwave, oven, or furnace used in
6

the synthesis methods, as the embodied energy and GWP data for these items could not be
reliably obtained.

In conducting the LCA, material and energy flows for each synthesis method were closely
tracked. Material inputs were measured by their consumption in grams. The power consumption
of the microwave and stir plate were measured using an Extech PQ2071 AC Clamp Meter. The
power consumption of the oven and muffle furnace were estimated based on their power ratings.
Emissions due to electricity usage, 0.2074 kg CO2/kW-h, was based on the PG&E’s 2009-2013
emissions average. CO2 equivalence for other greenhouse gases was based on the IPCC Fifth
Assessment Report6. The embodied energy and GWP were obtained using CES Edupack 2015
software unless otherwise stated. The values of embodied energies and flows are shown in Table
1.

3. Experimental Results
3.1 Microwave Synthesis Results
3.1.1 TEM
The TEM images of the MgO particles were much more revealing than the SEM images. The
particles produced by microwave synthesis took the form of nanocubes in the same manner of
magnesium smoke particles (Figure 7).

Figure 7. TEM images of MgO nanocubes and microparticles produced by microwave synthesis. (TEM
images courtesy of Prof. Jean Lee)

Not all of the particles produced in microwave synthesis are nanoparticles. Some of the particles
had characteristic dimensions of greater than 100 nm. However, this method also produced
particles smaller than 25 nm.
8

3.1.2 EDS
EDS results show that the MgO particles produced by microwave synthesis are of high purity.
The EDS spectrum shows that magnesium, oxygen, and copper were the only elements detected
in the microwave samples (Figure 8). The copper detected by EDS likely comes from the copper
grid that the sample is mounted on for TEM.

Figure 8. MgO nanoparticles produced by the microwave synthesis method exhibit clear peaks for
magnesium and oxygen. Copper peaks are present that are likely due to the copper TEM grid. (EDS
data courtesy of Prof. Jean Lee)

None of the iron or alloying elements from the steel wool were detected in the MgO particles. It
is possible that when the steel wool combusts, it immediately forms an ash that settles on the
bottom of the crucible rather than becoming dispersed in air.

Table 2 shows the quantitative composition results from EDS for particles produced using the
microwave synthesis method. The ratio of oxygen to magnesium is nearly 1:1 in terms of atomic
percent. From this data it can be concluded that the particles are made of high purity MgO.

3.2 Aqueous Synthesis Results
3.2.1 TEM
The TEM micrographs revealed that the particles produced by the aqueous synthesis method
were morphologically different than those produced by the microwave synthesis method (Figure

9

9). While particles produced by microwave synthesis were cubes with a wide range of sizes, the
particles produced by aqueous synthesis tended to be round and between 50 and 100 nm.

3.2.2 EDS
The EDS spectrum from the MgO synthesized by the aqueous method shows oxygen, carbon,
and silicon in addition to the expected magnesium and oxygen (Figure 10). As with the previous
EDS results, it is likely that the copper is present due to the TEM grid. Carbon is likely present
from the thin Formvar film coating the TEM grid. The small silicon peak is likely from the EDS
detector.

Prof. Jean Lee)

The composition of the nanoparticles was given in terms of weight percent (Table 3). The
relative quantities of oxygen and magnesium are compared to each other in Table 4. Pure MgO
is 38.8 weight % oxygen and 61.2 weight % magnesium, suggesting that the MgO particles
produced by the aqueous method is oxygen-rich. This excess oxygen may be due to the presence
of residual magnesium hydroxide and / or the oxygen in the Formvar film.

3.3 Life Cycle Assessment Results
Once the material flows were measured, the energy inputs from materials were calculated by
multiplying the mass of each material used for synthesis with its embodied energy and adding up
the results. This sum was then added to the measured or estimated values for power
consumption to get the total energy input for the process. This total energy was then divided by
the mass of MgO produced to estimate the embodied energy of the nanoparticles produced. The
process was then repeated with GWP in place of embodied energy to find the GWP of the
produced MgO nanoparticles. The results of the LCA can be seen in Figure 11.

The aqueous synthesis approach produces MgO nanoparticles with over ten times the embodied
energy and GWP of those produced by microwave synthesis. The reason for the disparity
becomes clear upon examination of the energy and GWP contributions by source for each
method (Figures 12, 13, 14, and 15).

For the microwave synthesis method, the biggest source of embodied energy was the cleaning
supplies. The major contributor in this category was cellulose Kimwipes used to clean the
crucible and other tools. The contribution of the Kimwipes is large because for every 15-17 mg
of MgO nanoparticles produced, about 3 grams of primary production cellulose in the form of
Kimwipes was used for cleaning equipment and tools.

Figure 11. LCA results showing embodied energy and GWP for each of the microwave and aqueous
methods of synthesizing MgO.

For the aqueous synthesis method, the electricity used in the stir plate, oven, and furnace makes
up the biggest embodied energy contribution. This is due to the fact the oven and furnace are run
at high temperatures for a long amount of time, and only about 0.26 grams of MgO were
produced using equipment made for heat treating macroscale samples. The same trends observed
with the embodied energy for each of the two synthesis methods can be seen with their GWPs
(Figure 13).

4. Discussion
4.1 Environmental Implications
This study suggests that the microwave method for producing MgO nanoparticles used less
energy and has a lower GWP than the aqueous synthesis method, but there are other
environmental factors that were not taken into account. If the processes were optimized and the
quantity of material being processed was increased, there would likely be a dramatic decrease in
embodied energy and GWP for both methods. None of the equipment in this study was used
anywhere near full capacity save for the stir plate in the aqueous synthesis method. In addition to
GHG emissions, other forms of waste should be considered. Microwave synthesis produces solid
waste in the form of iron oxide and MgO ash while aqueous synthesis produces a solution of
sodium nitrate. Due to the lengthy high temperature heat treatments required for the aqueous
13

synthesis method, the microwave synthesis method (or possibly another combustion synthesis
method) would likely be the more environmentally friendly option.

4.2 Structure of Produced MgO Nanoparticles
Microwave synthesis produced nanocubes with a wide range of sizes and what are likely to be
{100} facets corresponding to the Wulff construction for MgO nanoparticles. Aqueous synthesis,
on the other hand, produced rounder nanoparticles of more consistent size and shape. The
difference in shape may be due to a variety of factors. The shape of the MgO nanoparticles
produced by the aqueous synthesis method is likely due to the diffusion of surface atoms
resulting from the MgO particles being heated at an elevated temperature for a longer time in the
furnace in comparison to the microwave synthesis method. As temperature increases, the
differences in the surface energies of various crystalline planes can decrease, leading the
equilibrium shape to be more spherical, rather than favoring only the lowest energy surfaces12.
The structure could also relate to how magnesium hydroxide precipitates out of aqueous solution.
It is possible that after calcination, the shape of the particles doesn’t substantially change when
the material is converted from magnesium hydroxide to MgO as both materials are solids and
rely on diffusion to change shape.

4.3 Uncertainty in Data and Results
Neither synthesis process was optimized for efficiency. This may skew the results in favor of the
process that just happened to be more efficient. The processes studied were likely created for
laboratory study and for obtaining quick results. While this study encompasses the energy and
materials used to produce MgO nanoparticles using these two methods, some of the equipment
used were not included in the LCA. This was due to the difficulty in finding reliable estimates
for their embodied energy and GWP. The equipment that was not included are the microwave,
the stir plate, the oven, and a muffle furnace. Because the microwave is the only item missing
from the microwave synthesis LCA in contrast to much of the equipment not being included in
the aqueous synthesis LCA, the addition of the missing equipment to the LCAs is expected to
have a greater impact on the embodied energy and GWP of MgO nanoparticles produced via
aqueous synthesis. On the other hand, because lab equipment often has a long lifetime, the
impact of adding these appliances may be negligible in relation to the materials and energy
inputs if the equipment is used to produce a large quantity of MgO particles. Other areas that this
study did not explore are the energy costs of transporting material, or the effects of scaling

16

production. The estimations made for the energy consumption of the oven and furnace may be
very high as no empirical data was collected.

5. Conclusions
MgO particles produced by microwave synthesis form well-defined nanocubes with a wide
distribution of sizes including microscale particles (16 to 350 nm). MgO nanoparticles produced
by aqueous synthesis are rounder than those produced by microwave synthesis and appear to
have a narrower size distribution (between 30 and 90 nm).

At laboratory scale, the embodied energy and GWP of MgO nanoparticles produced using the
microwave synthesis method (5970 ± 550 MJ/kg and 416 ± 59 kg CO2/kg, respectively) were
found to be significantly less than those produced by aqueous synthesis (749,209 ± 28 MJ/kg and
42579 ± 11 kg CO2/kg, respectively) using LCA.
