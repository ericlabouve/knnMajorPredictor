ABSTRACT
This report was made to help the landowner of Bricker Farms make decisions regarding the
replanting of his orchard. The decisions that need to be made in this process include: which
crop to plant, how to plant it, and how to improve the distribution uniformity of irrigation
water on the orchard. The report does not give definitive final decisions, but presents viable
options that the landowner can utilize when deciding. In addition to the options that are
presented, the report offers suggestions to the landowner so that the replanting process is
done properly in a timely and economically-friendly manner.

INTRODUCTION
Bricker Farms was established in 1966 in Visalia, CA. The property consisted of 39
acres, however, after the 2015 harvest, six acres were sold to the land owner adjacent to
the North. As it stands currently, the property consists of 33 acres of walnuts – 24 acres
of Serr variety, planted in 1967, and 9 acres of Chandler variety, planted in 1988. The
Serr trees are approaching the end of their production life and need to be replanted soon.
The land owner, Walter Bricker, is thinking of replacing the 24 acres of Serr walnut trees
with either walnut trees again, or possibly pecan trees, within the next few years.
The farm manager and neighbor – Brody Blain, head of Blain Farms – planted
approximately 600 acres of pecan trees in early 2015 and has a surplus of seedlings –
enough to cover planting 24 acres. The land owner wishes to replant the 24 acres in the
most economical and hassle-free manner possible. It appears that the easiest way to meet
these wishes is to by-pass buying new trees from a nursery and dealing directly with the
farm manager.
The two parties discussed replanting the acreage with the excess pecan seedlings, and the
farm manager expressed interest in replanting the orchard via “transplantation”, or
individually transplanting each tree from one site to another. The seedlings currently are
planted in the ground on a small plot of land at the Blain Farm Shop, which is less than
one-half mile away from Bricker Farms. There are approximately 1000 seedlings, and
they have already been grafted. In addition to replanting, the owner of the property would
like to incorporate a new irrigation system with high distribution uniformity, while still
keeping the existing border strip system on all 33 acres.

2
So, there are three major areas of this replanting process that need to be covered: the
selection of the crop that is to be replanted on the 24 acres; the most economical manner
the crop can be planted; and the design of a new irrigation system to be installed without
abandoning the old system.
Crop Selection
This report will show the research and thought that goes into the decision making process
of selecting a crop to replant. Since the landowner has a longstanding relationship with
Blain Farms that has been successful, he would like to continue farming with them. That
being said, Blain Farms farms/processes/markets only walnuts and pecans. So, the
selection pool has been narrowed down to two possible crops: walnut trees or pecan trees.
With regards to ecological and economic factors, one crop will be chosen as a clear
favorite.
Replanting Process
After a crop is selected, the landowner must decide how the trees will replace the current
Serr walnut trees. As mentioned earlier, the landowner and farm manager have met and
discussed the idea of “transplanting” the more mature excess pecan trees after the
removal of the Serrs. This process entails moving trees individually that are more mature
(trees that are on their third leaf) that were stationed at a near-by site, as opposed to
planting younger trees straight from a nursery.
While this is not a common practice in the Visalia area, there are other areas of the
Country that plant their orchards via transplantation. According to the farm manager, if
executed properly, transplanting can offer the land owner multiple benefits, including
ease of planting (since the trees are in close proximity to the orchard) and a shorter period
of non-production once planting is finished. The largest potential benefit from
transplanting are the savings that are associated with planting three year old trees as
opposed to brand new seedlings. Due to size constraints, one can transplant a tree up until
the end of their third growing year. For example, if pecan trees take six years to produce
a first crop, the period of non-production will only be three years. Transplanting
essentially accelerates the period of non-production by three years, and this saves the
landowner money in the long run.
However, the farm manager has never performed this process, so there are risks. The
farm manager is performing a trial at the end of the 2016 year on a different orchard, and
this will help the landowner decide if he wants to transplant his own trees. If the
landowner decides to forgo the idea of transplanting, then he must buy separate trees
from a nursery and plant them in a traditional manner. A “traditional manner” entails
buying brand new seedlings, having them delivered to the orchard, and hiring labor to
plant them.
This report will not state the method of replanting that will be chosen by the landowner,
or which method is better. Instead, this report will compare the two methods, and a
spreadsheet that expresses the costs/savings of both methods will be produced. Since this

3
process will not be performed until early in the 2018 year, the landowner will have ample
time to decide which method is preferred.
Irrigation System Design
A border strip surface irrigation system has been in place the entire duration of time that
Bricker Farms has grown walnut trees. This system has proven to be adequate to meet the
demands of the orchard. However, with the improved technology that has occurred in the
last few decades, the landowner believes there are better alternatives to more effectively
irrigate the trees with a higher distribution uniformity. Original thoughts were that a
drip/micro system would be the best fit for the entire 33 acres.
In addition to installing a new drip/micro system, the landowner would like to keep the
existing border strip system for the sake of leaching and other reasons. This report will
demonstrate all considerations that must be made when designing a drip/micro system on
an orchard, and ultimately a finished design will be presented.
JAIN Irrigation. When attending an irrigation showcase in Long Beach, CA in November
2015, the author of this report was able to communicate the premise of the project with
some sales representatives of JAIN Irrigation Co. After explaining the preliminary
planning of a new irrigation system design, a representative stated that JAIN Irrigation
would donate the “above-ground” components for a new drip/micro system to be
installed. Above ground components include all hoses and microsprinklers. Therefore,
when designing the system, it will be designed to include JAIN products, since the
company has agreed to donate them at no cost because of their commitment to support
irrigation education.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Crop Selection
Walnuts and pecans are the two crops that have the possibility of being planted on the 24
acres of existing Serr walnuts. As one drives down Hwy 198 on the East side of Visalia,
trees bearing both crops can be seen from the road. Both nuts have proven to be
profitable in Tulare County, and both just happen to be the two nuts that Blain Farms
grows, harvests, processes, and markets. Before beginning to think about the irrigation
design or replanting method, the crop to be planted must be established.
Walnuts. California produces 99 percent of the nation’s commercial English walnuts with
almost all production taking place in the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys (Boriss et
al., 2006). According to the USDA, walnut production in California hit record numbers in
2014, grossing 570,000 tons, and growers are projecting an even larger crop in 2015. The
total bearing acreage in the state has now exceeded 300,000 acres. Walnuts belong to the
same family as the pecan, the Juglandaceae family, and originate from Persia (now Iran)
in Central Asia. It is thought that walnut trees first appeared in California with the
Spanish settlers in the 18th century, and were commercially produced near the end of the
19th century (Walnuts, 2014).
Walnut trees have two major components: a rootstock and a scion. There are two
common types of rootstock, the seedling Northern California black walnut (J. hindsii)
and seedling Paradox (Walnuts, 2014). The rootstock is the foundation of the tree; it is
what is planted and grown until budding, when a scion is grafted to the rootstock. The
“scion” is a cultivar of walnut; it is what one sees from the trunk of the tree upwards,
including all of the branches, leaves, and fruit. There are more than 30 cultivars of
walnuts in California, while only four make up 80% of production; those four cultivars
are Chandler, Howard, Hartley, and Tulare. Farmers use this grafting technique is
because each component does its job more effectively – the rootstock acts as an anchor in
the ground since it is much stronger and resistant to disease, while the scion produces
high quality consumable nuts.

5

Figure 2. Photo of a Chandler walnut tree at Bricker Farms. Note the visual difference
between the root stock and the scion.
There are generally two different methods to the structure of a walnut orchard. Due to
their large size, walnut trees are planted with much more space than almonds or
pistachios. A typical walnut orchard tree spacing is 30 x 30 ft. This spacing does not
produce as much yields in early years, but it is beneficial for the lifespan of the orchard.
Such a wide spacing allows sunlight to reach the lower branches of the trees once they
mature, because the canopy of a mature tree can prevent lower limb growth. Another
method is a 15 x 22 ft. tree spacing. This spacing allows for a higher return on investment
in the initial producing years, since there are more trees, but can cause issues in the
future. Because of the thin row spacing and significant canopy cover, labor costs for
pruning can be much greater (Walnuts, 2014).
Walnuts are harvested using a three-step process. First a mechanical shaker grips the
trunk of the tree and shakes the tree, so that the nuts fall to the ground. Next, a sweeper
goes between the rows and sweeps the fallen nuts and debris into the center of each row.
Finally, a harvester separates the nuts from debris and collects the nuts to take to a
dehydrator. This process is done quickly to minimize the time that the nuts remain on the
ground.

6
Some of the diseases that can damage walnut orchards include walnut blight, crown gall,
blackline, and deep bark canker. These diseases are spread through fungal, bacterial, or
viral pathogens. Some of the insects/pests that damage walnut orchards include codling
moth, scale, mites, walnut husk fly, and nematodes. All pests with the exception of
nematodes cause damage above ground, which affects yearly nut quality and quantity.
Nematodes are a deep-rooted issue, which will be covered in greater detail later.
Pecans. The United States produces 80 to 95% of the world’s pecans from native stands
and cultivated orchards of selected cultivars (Pecan, 2014). Unlike walnuts, pecans are
grown throughout the United States, not simply in California. In fact, California is not
even a top producer. The state with the most acreage of bearing trees is Georgia, and a
number of southern states stretching from Georgia to California cultivate pecans. In
2014, the United States produced 133,165 tons of pecans (in-shell) valued at
$417,758,000. California's 2500 tons, valued at $10,300,000, represented less than 2% of
this domestic product. However, commercial pecan production is rather new to
California, beginning around 1970 in the Fresno area. A pecan tree can produce fruit for
up to 300 years (Pecan, 2014).
Similar to walnuts, pecan trees consist of a rootstock and a cultivar. The most common
cultivars for pecans are Wichita, Cheyenne, Pawnee, Western Schley, and Shoshone.
Pecan trees require pollination from separate varieties. For instance, the Wichita variety
is a great pollinator of Pawnee and Western varieties (Linwood). Therefore, when
establishing an orchard, it is recommended to plant one row of pollinator cultivar for
every four rows of typical cultivars.
According to Linwood Nursery, there are three different patterns of planting an orchard:
1) square, where the distance between rows and trees are the same 2) hedgerow, where
the distance between rows is much greater than the distance between trees 3) equilateral
triangle, where the distance between trees are the same, but each row is offset. In
California traditional pecan orchards contain approximately 50 trees per acre: at 35 x 25
ft. (49 trees/ac) or 30 x 30 ft. (48 trees/ac) spacing (Pecan, 2014). However, according to
Texas A&M, some orchards in Texas are spaced as widely as 50 or 60 feet apart. The
University states that 50% of the orchard floor should receive sunlight at midday in the
summer in order to achieve maximum production. In cases where the trees are spaced
tightly and are more crowded, pruning is an annual necessity.
Unlike walnuts, which produce similar yields annually, pecan trees alternate bear,
oscillating between heavy and light crop production across years; the degree of
alternation can be managed to some extent with proper culture and cultivar selection
(Pecan, 2014). One way of manipulating the orchard to regulate yearly yields is to
perform a pre-shaking, where the trees are shaken in summer if there appears to be a
heavy crop. By doing this, not only is the current year’s crop affected, but it also helps
manipulate the following year’s crop. Similar to walnuts, pecan harvesting is a three-step
process – shaking, sweeping, and collecting. Harvest usually begins between October and
December. When 70 to 80 percent of the nut clusters have open shucks and kernel
moisture is below 10 percent, harvesting can begin (Upson, 2012).

7

Figure 3. When the shucks begin to open, as seen in this photo, pecans are mature and
ready for harvest. (Upson, 2012)
Pecan trees face different obstacles depending on location. In Texas, pecan growers face
many diseases and insects. Pecan scab can be the worst disease, followed by downy spot,
powdery mildew, and many others (Nesbitt et al., 2013). In addition, insects such as
pecan nut casebearer, the pecan weevil, and hickory shuckworm can cause damage to
trees. Cases of nematodes have been found in Texas. In California, however, growers are
much luckier. According to Linwood Nursery, the only insect problems that one may face
in California are aphids and mites.
Nematode Susceptibility. The largest factor in the crop selection are nematodes in the
soil.
Plant parasitic nematodes are microscopic roundworms that feed on plant roots.
They live in soil and plant tissues. The species of nematode most commonly
found causing problems in soils of walnut orchards in California is lesion
nematode, Pratylenchus vulnus. Ring nematode (Mesocriconema xenoplax) is
also damaging to walnuts, and root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) cause
problems on Paradox and English walnut rootstocks. (UC Davis IPM)
As stated above, walnut trees are susceptible to damage from nematodes. The UC Davis
IPM (2009) continues by saying that the severity of damage due to nematodes varies
based on tree age and insect population density. In addition, if young trees are planted in
an area of high infestation, the roots will be damaged and tree growth will be stunted.

8
Mature trees can tolerate nematodes and still produce, but it is not a good idea to plant
young walnut trees in a nematode-infested zone. Therefore, management decisions must
be made when replanting a walnut orchard.
In the past, the best way to overcome nematode infestation was to fumigate with Methyl
Bromide (hereinafter referred to as MB). MB is a soil fumigant that is nothing short of a
miracle for pest control – one single treatment could control a nematode populations so
replanting was not an issue (Meadows, 2013). If MB were to be used in this case, the
replanting issue would be solved. However, MB is considered a health and environmental
hazard; the gas is volatile and much of the soil injection rises to the atmosphere,
contributing to the thinning of the ozone. In fact, the Montreal Protocol, signed in 1987,
attempted to eliminate the usage of the gas. There are still specific situations where
applications are still technically legal, but Caprile and McHenry (2006) state that its price
rises with each year, and it is better to try different alternatives.
There are many alternatives to solve the nematode issue when replanting, but none come
close to the success of MB applications. Waiting extensive amounts of time, using less
hazardous fumigants, rotating crops, and fertilizing are the alternative methods laid out
by Caprile and McHenry (2006), but this process would take several years before the soil
is ready for young walnut trees. According to UC Davis IPM (2009), waiting five years
after an application of triclopyr will reduce nematode numbers by 95%. It also
recommends selecting a rootstock that is able to tolerate low numbers of nematodes, such
as Paradox, although even the most resilient rootstocks are still susceptible. So, since MB
is not a viable option at this point in time, it could take years to control the nematode
population in order to replant with young walnut trees. The landowner is assuming there
is a nematode issue with the orchard, but further testing will confirm this.
Pecan trees, on the other hand, do not have the same obstacle when replanting an orchard.
According to UC Davis IPM, nematode problems in pecans have not been reported in
California. Not one source stated that pecan trees are nematode susceptible in California.
In fact, Freeman et al. (2005) explicitly states there are no known economic disease or
nematode problems with pecans in California. However, according to Nesbitt et al.
(2013), pecans in Texas can be attacked by root-knot nematodes. Given the track record
of pecan trees in California, it appears that nematodes due not pose a serious threat when
replanting with young trees. Farm manager, Brody Blain, also stated that his family has
never seen issues with nematodes among pecan orchards in their multiple decades of
farming, but have directly seen the impacts of nematodes on walnut trees. Therefore, it is
possible to replant young pecan trees on the 24 acres of soil without having to wait and
control pests.
Replanting Process & Cost savings
Since there is no question how the ripping/removing of the existing trees will happen, the
big question is this: how will the young trees be planted? In this case, there are two
options: a traditional planting or a transplanting. There are constraints involving the
second option, while the first option is feasible essentially any time.

9
Traditional Planting. This process involves planting trees that come straight from the
nursery into the desired location. A 12-step process, beginning with planting during the
dormant season to painting for sun protection, is laid out explicitly on the Linwood
Nursery website. Whether planting walnut or pecan trees, this process can be started by
making an order to nursery well ahead of the desired planting date.
Using this method will typically result in a seven year waiting period before seeing a
return, since a young orchard does not produce a profitable crop until year seven. In
addition, this method requires that the land owner contact a nursery and place an order for
trees to be planted. However, this method does give the land owner flexibility in when he
chooses to replant, in case he chooses not to remove the current trees after the 2017
harvest.
Transplanting. This process involves moving individual trees from an off-site location to
the desired planting location. The main difference with this method is that the young trees
are not straight from the nursery. Instead, they have already been planted on a lot at the
Blain Farms shop facility, located less than one-half mile away. It is assumed that all
input (trees) and labor costs involved with this method are the same as the traditional
planting method, but this method may be favorable because of the time saved before
seeing production on the young trees.
This method will hopefully save the landowner money in the long run, since the young
trees will have already been growing for three years prior to transplantation. Therefore,
since pecan trees do not begin to produce until year seven, the land owner should begin to
see returns around year four, as opposed to the traditional method.
The current arrangement with Blain Farms is as follows: Blain Farms holds all
responsibility for the young trees, including irrigating and maintenance. Should the
landowner choose to transplant these trees, Blain Farms will charge the landowner on a
per-tree basis; should the landowner choose to not transplant these young trees, Blain
Farms will disk the trees under at no cost to the landowner.
This method includes the following constraints:
 Survival. In order for the transplant method to be possible, the young trees must
be alive. In order to satisfy the 24 acres at the desired spacing, there must be
enough young trees. For instance, if the spacing is 30 x 30 ft., resulting in 48 trees
per acre, there must be 1,104 living young trees available. If the number of trees
that survive is not sufficient, the plan would be thwarted.
 Time. If the landowner wishes to go through with the transplant method, the
existing Serr walnuts must be removed following the 2017 harvest. The reason for
this is the young pecan trees were planted at the start of the 2015 calendar year,
and they must be transplanted within three years, so it is essential that they be
planted in the winter of 2018.

10
Irrigation System Design
After establishing the crop to be replanted, the next step is to design an irrigation system
before replanting can take place. Not only will the new system irrigate the 24 acres of
new young trees to be planted, but it will also irrigate the existing 9 acres of Chandler
walnuts. In order to properly design the system, each individual component must be
properly sized, from the water emitters to the mainline. To begin, it is important to look
at the ETc demands of walnut and pecan trees.
Crop Evapotranspiration and Soil. Evapotranspiration (ET) is the combined process of
evaporation from soil and plant surfaces, and transpiration from plants (Burt and Styles,
2011). ET is dependent on the following things: location, time of year, and crop. The ET
will tell the irrigator how much water is used over a period of time (daily, monthly,
yearly), so the owner must base his irrigation system around the needs of both walnuts
and pecans.
The ET of a particular crop, ETc, can be derived from the following equation:
ETc = ETo * Kc
ETc = Crop evapotranspiration
ETo = Grass referenced evapotranspiration
Kc = Crop coefficient

(1)

When designing an irrigation system, it must be done conservatively. Therefore, the
system must be designed so that it can meet the demands of the crops when they
experience peak ETc rates. The website for the Irrigation Training and Research Center
(ITRC) has published documents which give ETc information based on location, time of
year, and crop. The information on the ITRC website is made possible by the monitoring
of California Irrigation Management Information Station (CIMIS) stations, which record
the ETo at different sites throughout the State of California, and divides the State in
different zones. According to the ITRC, the peak month for evapotranspiration at the
location of the orchard is July. So, when designing the system, it must be capable of
supplying enough water so that the trees are not under-watered in the month of July. In
addition to meeting demands at peak times, the system is designed for worst-case
scenarios. The tables accessed on the ITRC website gave ETo data for a dry year, when
ETo rates are higher over the course of the year. This table was chosen in place of a table
representing a wet year, so that the system is designed to supply the absolute most water
the plants will need over the course of a year.
In order to determine the ETc for walnuts or pecans, the crop coefficient of each crop
must be found. This Kc value varies between crops, and even varies within the same crop
throughout the year. The following table represents the crop coefficient for walnuts in
Manteca, CA.

It was difficult to find Kc values for pecan trees. According to the Food and Agriculture
Organization for the United Nations (FAO, 2016), there is no particular crop coefficient
specific to pecan trees. Instead, pecans are categorized as a stone fruit, and share the same
Kc values as peaches, apricots, pears, and plums. There is also data available that states
the evapotranspiration rates of pecan trees in New Mexico, but this data is not valid for
the sake of this project, which is located in the Central Valley of California. According to
farm manager Brody Blain, pecan trees generally require 1.2 times the amount of water
that walnut trees require, whether it be over the course of a week during peak ETc rates or
over the course of an entire year. So, when solving for ETc of pecan trees, there will be an
adjusted Kc value that is 1.2 times the crop coefficient of walnut trees in the area.
In addition to crop evapotranspiration, the soil is a factor when designing system needs.
One may be able to apply the required flows and pressures for hours, but it is not
beneficial irrigation if the soil cannot handle the volume of water being applied. The soil
contains a certain readily available water, or RAW, storage amount. This volume of water
is looked at in terms of gallons per tree. Different soil types will offer different RAW

12
storage values, which are affected by management allowable depletion (MAD), the root
zone available water holding capacity (AWHC) of the soil, and the wetted area. So, when
designing the irrigation scheduling, the system must be designed to run a maximum
duration so that there is not more water being applied than the RAW storage can handle,
or deep percolation and inefficient irrigation will occur.
Soil map surveys can be acquired via the Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS). An outline of the desired area is made and the online service gives the user
information regarding the soil characteristics in that area. After completing the steps
needed to retrieve this information, it was determined that 100% of the soil in the area of
Bricker Farms consists of a Grangeville sandy loam.
Surface Irrigation vs. Drip/Micro Irrigation. The entire 33 acres currently are irrigated
using a border strip irrigation method, a form of surface irrigation. The existing system
has proven effective in irrigating the orchard over several decades, but new technology is
available that could improve farm production. The landowner would like to keep the
existing system (for multiple reasons, including potential leaching), but install a new
system that will benefit production on a long-term basis.
A common drip/micro irrigation system for almond and pistachio orchards is drip
emitters. These systems operate by directly discharging water through long hoses with inline or on-line emitters. The emitters slowly trickle out water at a rate of 0.5 – 2.0 gallons
per hour (gph); it is common to have two emitters per tree. However, for pecan and
walnut orchards, the trees prefer a larger wetting area. Therefore, microsprinklers are a
better alternative to drip emitters – microsprinklers have rotating parts with an emission
device that throws water horizontally and vertically with a sprinkler pattern (Burt and
Styles, 2011). According to Brody Blain, Farm Manager, it is essential that the irrigation
system wets approximately 90% of the area, at the least. Therefore, a microsprinkler that
provides a large wetted diameter should be chosen.
According to JAIN Irrigation, the supplier offers three different models of
microsprinklers: Eliminator, 2002 AquaSmart PC, and 2005 AquaMaster (non-PC). The
first two models do not offer a large enough wetted diameter to irrigate a mature pecan
orchard, so the 2005 AquaMaster microsprinklers would be a viable option to install. A
technical brochure states that the 2005 AquaMaster product features nine color-coded
nozzles that have flow ranges from 7 to 79 GPH at a working pressure of 29 PSI, and a
wetted diameter ranges of 18 to 39.4 feet. Additionally, it states that this model of
microsprinkler is intended for application on almond, walnut, pecan, stone-fruit, and
citrus orchards.
Installing a microsprinkler system offers many benefits to farms. Some potential
advantages of a drip/micro system include: 1) the ability to be used on extremely steep
ground, whereas flood or sprinklers cannot; 2) there generally are no runoff problems to
contend with; 3) the ability to apply fertilizer directly to the root zone at any stage of
growth on any day and with any dosage, without wetting plant foliage; 4) systems can be
installed on virtually any size or shape of parcel 5) Distribution Uniformity (DU) of such

13
systems can be very high (0.93 or higher) when the system is designed and maintained
properly.
Potential disadvantages of drip/micro systems include: 1) DU can degrade over time from
a multitude of sources. Poor management, poor filtration, rodents, and insects can all
cause a drip/micro system to suffer DU losses; 2) Such systems are susceptible to
vandalism and theft; 3) Evaporation losses can be high in a micro system that wet large
areas of bare soil; 4) There is generally a very high initial cost for these systems; and 5) It
is possible to buy parts for the system from an inept or faulty dealer; it is essential to use
quality components for the system to function properly.

The emitter type that is chosen will depend on its throw diameter, flow rate, and
operating pressure. The relationship between flow and pressure is as follows:
𝑄 = 𝑘𝑃 𝑥

(2)

The flow rate, Q, is impacted by the k value, which is a constant depending upon the units
and orifice size, the pressure, P, and the emitter discharge exponent, x. For pressure
compensating (PC) emitters, it is assumed that the exponent is equal to zero over a range,
since the flow rate stays the same as long as there is a minimum pressure. For nonpressure compensating (non-PC) emitters, the flow rate will always increase as the
pressure increases (Burt and Styles, 2011). Therefore, if one is looking to have an emitter
that discharges similar flow rates across a range of pressures, a smaller exponent value is
desired. All emitters have different flow rate/pressure relationships, as seen in the figure
below.

14

Hydraulics. One may determine the pressure at a point in the system using Bernoulli’s
Equation. This equation accounts for all components of pressure within a pipeline –
pressure (P), in terms of either psi or feet; elevation (E), in terms of feet; velocity head;
and friction loss (Hf), in terms of feet. However, when in the context of a drip system on
a small farm, velocity head is ignored because of its miniscule effect on the system. The
equation is displayed below:
𝑃1 + 𝐸1 = 𝑃2 + 𝐸2 + 𝐻𝑓

(3)

The formula allows the user to find the pressure and elevation at a certain point, and the
loss of pressure due to friction over a span. The friction loss, or Hf, can be found using
the Hazen-Williams formula. Variables affecting the friction loss in a pipeline include the
flow rate inside the pipe (GPM), the roughness or material of the pipe (c value), the
length of the pipe (L), and the I.D. of the pipe. The formula is displayed below:
𝐻𝑓 = 10.5 ∗ (

𝐺𝑃𝑀 1.852
𝐶

)

∗ 𝐿 ∗ 𝐼. 𝐷.−4.87

(4)

Hoses and Pipelines. When sizing the hoses and pipelines that supply water to the
microsprinklers, one must account for both the pressures and flow rates inside the pipe.
For the underground pipe, these lines will be composed of poly-vinyl chloride (PVC).
The classification of the pipe will be Iron Pipe Size (IPS), which is preferred instead of
Plastic Irrigation Pipe (PIP) on pipes with a diameter less than 12 inches. Each size of
IPS pipe has a certain pressure (psi) rating, and the system should be designed so that the
pressure in the pipe is not greater than the rating of the pipe.
In addition, the system will be designed using economic pipe sizing, or a “maximum
velocity” method. This means that the designer selects pipes as small as possible, but
does not exceed a velocity of 4 feet per second in any segment (Burt and Styles, 2011).

15
The reason this method is used is because smaller pipe is cheaper than large pipe, so
going as small as possible will minimize capital costs. However, if they are too small, the
velocity in the pipe will be greater than 4 feet per second, and this will lead to both
increased pumping costs (because of higher friction losses) and a greater potential for
water hammer.
Distribution Uniformity. Distribution Uniformity (DU) is a term that relates to the
evenness of water application to plants throughout a field (Burt and Styles, 2011). It can
also be described by the following formula.
Average low quarter depth of water

DUlq= Average depth of water accumulated in all elements

(5)

Achieving a high DU is essential for optimal crop production. According to Burt and
Styles (2011), the DU for a new drip/micro system that has been designed and installed
properly should consistently fall in high (>0.93) ranges. The two biggest factors that
negatively affect DU are pressure differences and other causes of flow variation
(plugging); these two factors account for 95% of DU problems with drip/micro systems
in California. A system must be maintained and operated properly or DU problems can
occur.
Filters. Filtration is necessary for a drip or micro-sprayer system to function properly.
The sources of irrigation water include groundwater and ditch water, which can include
solids that can be detrimental to the system. According to Burt and Styles (2011), there
are several reasons why filtration is needed, including: pump wear, emitter plugging,
micro-sprayer wear, and the accumulation of solids in pipelines. All of these situations
can occur when solids are present in the system, but can be avoided with proper filtration.
There are many methods of filtration, including, but not limited to: sand separators,
media tanks, tubular screens, gravity overflow screens, and disc filters (Burt and Styles,
2011). For the sake of this project, the land owner would prefer to use media filters in the
new irrigation system. Media filters, also known as “sand filters”, generally are vertical
tanks filled with a media that prevents solids from being introduced into the sub-main
lines and sprayers. The following diagram demonstrates the multiple processes of the
media tanks.

Figure 6. Processes performed by media filter tanks. Courtesy of Burt and Styles (2011).

16

As water flows downward through the tanks, solids are retained by the media, allowing
clean water to exit the outlet into the system. Therefore, the tanks must be backflushed
periodically to remove such solids. In addition to a backflush release system, the tanks
may also require other hardware, such as air vents and pressure relief valves.
To properly select the correct tank and media size, a three step process must be
performed. First, the tank size and number of tanks must be determined based on the
irrigation system’s flow rate and water quality. Next, the mean filtration capacity must be
determined. According to Burt and Styles (2011), a common rule of thumb is to remove
all particles larger than 1/10th of the diameter of the smallest passage in the emitters. For
sprayers, the ratio used is often 1/7 if the sprayer has a simple short orifice. Lastly, after
determining the needed filtration size, one must select the proper media.
Pressure Regulators. Pressure regulators are often used in drip/micro irrigation systems to
regulate the downstream pressure in a pipe. They can be used at either at the entrance to a
manifold from the main line or at the entrance to a lateral from a manifold. According to
Burt and Styles (2011), a pre-set pressure regulator will have a 1 - 5 psi minor loss in
friction. So, if the desired pressure downstream of the regulator is 20 psi, the upstream
pressure should be 24 - 25 psi. If it is less, the pressure regulator will not operate
correctly, and instead will serve as an obstruction in the pipe. With adjustable pressure
regulators it is important to be aware of the pressure control range of the regulator. Some
regulators may work well above 15 psi, but may be useless at lower pressure ranges.
When studying adjustable valve (AV) pressure regulators that were placed at the head of
each lateral (hose) on a simulated field, Ella et al. (2013) found that the system’s average
DU ranged from 64% to 91% with AV adjustment and from only 25% to 87% without
AV adjustment. While this study proves that pressure regulation is helpful when it comes
to improving the DU in a field, it may not be relevant to this project. It would not be
reasonable to install an AV pressure regulator at the head of each hose because of labor
costs. Instead, it would make more sense to install pre-set regulators at the head of each
hose, or an AV pressure regulator at the head of each manifold.
Air Vents. Air vents are required on drip/micro systems for three reasons (Burt and
Styles, 2011). The first reason is to release of large volumes of air on startup, and to
prevent air blockages and water hammer. This occurs with special valves that only
function before the system is under pressure. The second reason is for the continuous
release of air after the system has been pressurized. This is necessary to prevent water
hammer and air blockages. This requires a special air vent that has a smaller orifice than
the large volume air release valves. And lastly, air vents prevent vacuums in the lines
after shutoff. In general, the vacuum relief function is part of the large volume air release
valve design.
Air vents should be placed throughout the system accordingly. Burt and Styles (2011)
states that air release vents should be placed at least every 1320 feet on pipelines and

17
downstream of all air entry points to release air. Additionally, vacuum relief valves
should be placed at all high points and downstream of shutoff valves.
According to Netafim (2004), there are three different types of air vents: 1) air/vacuum
relief vents, which discharge large amounts of air when a pipeline is being pressurized
and admit air when water exits the pipe 2) air release vents, which release small amounts
of air after the vacuum vent closes because the pipeline is pressurized 3) combination air
vents, which perform all functions of the other two types.

PROCEDURES AND METHODS
Crop Selection
In order to determine what crop was going to replace the 24 acres of Serr walnut trees,
first the landowner was consulted. His preference was to stay with the same farm
manager, so this narrowed the potential crops to two options: walnuts or pecans. From
there, research was performed in the Literature Review. Then, when meeting with the
farm manager, all aspects of the research were discussed, and it was agreed that one
option is better than the other. These results will be discussed in the next section.
Replanting Process
In order to determine what method of planting should occur, spreadsheets representing
the costs of either method were produced. This required meeting with the farm manager
and receiving individual costs on activities that must be performed in order to replant and
farm an orchard. Then, two spreadsheets were made – one for the costs of “transplanting”
over a nine year period, and one for the costs of a “traditional” planting over a nine year
period. One can see the economical differences between the two methods via these
spreadsheets, and it is clear that one method will save the landowner both time and
money.
Irrigation System Design
Field and Micro Sprinkler Constraints. In order to find the constraints of the field, the
field was surveyed prior to beginning the design. The surveying was performed by the
land owner and the author of this report. The tools that were used to survey the field were
an automatic level and a Philadelphia Rod. It was found that there is a maximum change
in elevation of only 3 feet over a span of 2000 feet, which amounts to essentially a 0%
change in slope along rows. There was no change in elevation across rows.
The spacing of the Chandler walnut trees was measured using a cloth tape measure. It
was determined that the trees are 27 feet apart along the rows, and 32 feet apart across
rows. The pecan trees have yet to be planted, so the tree spacing for those was decided
after researching pecan tree orchards and talking to the Farm Manager. The land owner
decided that the optimal spacing for the pecan trees to be planted is 30 feet along rows
and 35 feet across rows.
The soil type of the field was determined by performing a soil survey via the Natural
Resources Conservation Service. This can be completed online, and the result of the
survey was that 100% of the field is a Grangeville sandy loam. More information
regarding soil type can be seen in Appendix E.
The maximum flow rate available to the field was determined by checking with the
landowner. The landowner stated that the flow rate from the well at the end of the 2015

19
season was approximately 350 gallons per minute (GPM). The landowner also stated that
the design should be done assuming this is the maximum flow rate, even though in past
years the flow rates have been in the neighborhood of 400-450 GPM. The reduced flow
(compared to past years) is due to a multi-year drought that has delivered minimal to zero
surface water, leaving farmers to rely solely on groundwater to irrigate their crops. An
extended reliance on groundwater has led to excessive groundwater pumping and
diminishing groundwater levels. Since the depth to groundwater is greater than ever
before, the total dynamic head (TDH) of the pump is higher. As one may see on a pump
curve, an increased TDH results in a lower flow rate (GPM). However, the landowner is
confident that the drought will not remain forever, meaning groundwater levels will rise,
and the flow rate from the well (with the same pump) will not dip below 350 GPM. Since
the well pump – as well as the turnout from the ditch – discharges into an open standpipe,
there is minimal pressure entering the system.
As for the microsprinkler constraints, the main constraint was that the microsprinkler
must be chosen from a JAIN technical brochure. Additionally, it was preferred that the
nozzle on the sprinkler have an orifice size greater than 0.04 inches to avoid plugging. It
was also determined that the spaghetti hose length to the microsprinkler be 5 feet, so that
it gives the land owner flexibility on the exact location of the sprinkler between trees.
Determine Peak ET. In order to find the peak ETc rate, research was conducted to find
grass-referenced (ETo) rates and crop coefficients (Kc). ETo rates were found via the
ITRC website, where they list these rates based on the type of irrigation system (in this
case, drip/micro), type of year in terms of precipitation, and region. A “dry” year was
chosen when finding ET rates, because the design should be done so that it delivers as
much as water as is needed by the crop, and the crop will require the most water in a
“dry” year. Lastly, the region was chosen by selecting a zone on a map of California; for
this design, in Visalia, the field fell in zone 12. After finding the grass-referenced ET
rates, the crop coefficient was found in order to determine the ETc rates of the trees. As
seen in the literature review, Table 1 states the crop coefficient for walnuts over the
course of a year in Manteca, CA. It was decided that the climate in Manteca is
comparable to Visalia, so these values are valid for this design. When solving for the
pecan crop coefficients, it was very difficult to find information on the web. Also stated
in the literature review, it was decided that the crop coefficient for pecan trees (Kc
adjusted) will be 1.2 times the crop coefficient for walnut trees.

Estimate GPH/Tree Needed. In order to estimate the flow rate, in terms of gallons per
hour (GPH), per tree, the equations below were used.
𝐺𝑃𝑀 (𝑛𝑒𝑡) =

𝑖𝑛∗𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑒 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎
96.3∗ℎ𝑟𝑠
𝐺𝑃𝑀 (𝑛𝑒𝑡)

𝐺𝑃𝑀 (𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑠𝑠) = ((1−𝑠𝑝𝑟𝑎𝑦 𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑠)∗𝐷𝑈)

(6)
(7)

These equations allow the user to solve for the flow rate required, given the area of the
element, the hours of operation, and the inches required by the tree. For the Chandler
walnuts, the peak ETc rates were 1.99 in/week, and the tree spacing is 27 feet by 32 feet,
so the flow rate per tree was determined by altering the hours of operation until it was a
preferred amount. The gross value is used because it allows for enough flow to the trees
even after the system deteriorates, when the DU drops to 0.85. The gross GPM per tree –
assuming 36 hours/week for walnut block, 120 hours/week for pecan block – was found
and converted to GPH per tree by diving the value by 60. The reason for converting to
GPH per tree is that microsprinkler flow rates are given in terms of GPH, not GPM. The
hours of operation per week was decided based on the estimated pump GPM. The overall
flow rate required by the system can be found by solving for the GPM with the total area
of a block. It is important to remember that the overall flow rate is not the maximum flow
rate will be required – additional flow will be needed when a tank is backflushing. If the
system only ran during off-peak hours for the pecan block (80 hours per week), the
required flow rate for the block would exceed the discharge from the well pump.
Therefore, 120 hours was used because it fit the pump flow rate and allowed for other
conveniences, which are discussed later on.
Estimate Number of Micro Sprinklers/Tree. In order to estimate the number of
microsprinklers per tree, the wetted area was determined. This was done by multiplying
the element (area dedicated to one tree) by 0.9, since it was stated that the land owner
wishes to achieve a 90% wetted area by the irrigation system. After solving for the wetted
area, the diameter that would achieve this wetted area was found. The diameter that

21
achieves a 90% wetted area should equal the throw diameter of the microsprinkler if there
is to be one microsprinkler per tree; if not, multiple microsprinklers should be chosen.
Select the Proper Microsprinkler & Number of Sets. In order to find the proper
microsprinkler and number of sets used on each crop, first the “k” value of each nozzle
was determined. There were four different nozzle types to choose from; these four
nozzles were eligible because of their orifice size, throw diameter, and nominal flow rate.
The JAIN technical brochure supplied the throw diameters at a certain pressure, as well
as flow rates at different pressures. Since the flow rate, pressure, and emitter exponents
were all known, the k value was able to be found by dividing the flow by the pressure to
the power of the exponent. The table below shows the k values of the different nozzle
types.

Now a selection table was developed that examined different numbers of sets using
different nozzle colors. In the table below, the pressure for each nozzle color is solved for
- once the desired GPH/sprayer is known. An emitter exponent of 0.5 is used for these
microsprinklers.

As shown in Table 4, the pecan design uses an orange nozzle with two sets. Note that the
GPH/microsprinkler is double what is needed if there were one set; this is because there
are two sets, so the irrigation time per tree is cut in half, so the flow is doubled. Two sets
were selected for several reasons, including that the JAIN catalog recommends the
microsprinklers have a working pressure between 20 and 35 psi. Additionally, the size of
the field is ideal to divide it in half – by creating two sets, each set serves 12 acres,
similar in size to the walnut set, and makes three total sets (one walnut, two pecan) of
similar flow rate requirements.

22

It is also convenient to choose two sets because it means the orange nozzle is then used
on every emitter on the orchard. Using just one type of nozzle is not only easier to order
from a dealer, but it also means it is easier to replace a nozzle at any place on the orchard,
since there is one universal emitter. This eliminates confusion in the field when changing
emitters.
Locate and Position Manifolds, Determine Hose Sizes. The manifolds were placed with
help from the Manifold placement program made by the ITRC. Even though the program
outputs an uphill and downhill location for the manifold within the entire field, the
manifold was placed based on the shape of the field, not simply the output number from
the program. For the walnuts, the Western manifold was not positioned at the location
given by the program because of the neighbor’s lot in the SW corner. For the pecans, the
placement of the manifolds was based on the shape of the field due to the creek on the
North side of the field.
Even though the manifold program was not used for the location of the manifolds, it was
still useful for finding the average pressures and flows in one hose lateral, the DU of
hose, and the inlet pressure into the hose. Additionally, the manifold placement program
helps find the ideal hose I.D. for the laterals for the tradeoff between high DU and inlet
pressure. The output hose DU from the program was 0.97 for both the walnut and pecan
blocks.
Determine the Allowable Change in Pressure. When solving for the allowable change in
pressure within the manifold, know that the DU of the system is represented by the
equation shown below.
𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝐴𝑙𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑆𝑦𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚 𝐷𝑈 = 𝑀𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑑 𝐷𝑈 ∗ 𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 𝐻𝑜𝑠𝑒 𝐷𝑈

(8)

As stated earlier, the system is designed for a DU of 0.92; this is the minimum allowable
system DU. The single hose DU is the output from the manifold placement program; this
value was 0.97. Therefore, in order to ensure the overall DU of the system is 0.92, the
minimum manifold DU must be the value of the system DU divided by the single hose
DU. After solving this value, it was determined that the manifold DU must be equal to or
greater than 0.95.
The manifold DU is held at a high value by minimizing the pressure loss within the
manifold. So, to ensure that the manifold DU is what it is supposed to be, the allowable
change in pressure must be found and the manifold must be sized so that the change in
pressure in the pipeline does not exceed its allowable value. To find the allowable change
in pressure, the equation below was used:
Allowable ΔP = 2[Pavg - Pavg(DUsystem/DUhose)1/x]

(9)

The pressure regulation strategy that has been defined for this step does not allow
individual pressure regulators at the start of each hose, nor does it allow PC emitters to be

23
used. The allowable pressures difference downstream of the pressure regulation point
includes pressure differences along the manifold and the pressure differences along the
hoses. Since this design does not allow for PC emitters or regulators at the head of each
hose, a pressure regulator will be placed at the head of every manifold.
Manifold Sizing. The manifolds were sized so that the change in pressure along a single
manifold did not exceed its allowable ΔP. For the walnuts, the allowable change in
pressure was 6.97 psi; for the pecans, the allowable change in pressure was 5.33 psi.
Normally, when designing a system based on DU, pipe sizes are selected so that the
actual pressure change across the manifold is as close as possible to the allowable
pressure change without exceeding it. By doing this, the designer ensures DU
requirements are met and also the installation costs are minimized (smaller pipe is used,
which is cheaper to purchase). However, when designing for the walnut block, the
manifold was sized well under the allowable pressure change. This was done for multiple
reasons. First, it offers an even better system DU. Secondly, while it may increase
installation costs, it lowers operating costs because less pressure is required at the head of
the manifold, meaning less pressure is required at the pump, which lowers the
horsepower being used by the motor. Lastly, and holding the most weight, it makes the
pressure required at the pump for the walnut set is similar to the pressure required at the
pump by the pecan sets.
The pecan manifolds were sized normally, so the pipes are as small as possible but still
meet allowable pressure requirements. That being said, the pecan manifolds do not
require as much inlet pressure as the walnut manifolds due to their lower operating
pressures of the microsprinklers. So, by overdesigning the walnut manifolds, the
difference in pressure required at the pump between the different sets is minimized. This
will play a role later, when deciding if a VFD is needed for the booster pump.
When sizing the manifolds, IPS PVC pipe sizes were used. The minimum pipe rating that
should be used in this design is Class 125 since they are pressures as high as 53 psi. This
is especially important on the mainline because it could change the TDH due to a smaller
I.D. The table below shows the dimensions and “C” values of different nominal pipe
sizes.

In order to size the manifolds so that they did not exceed the allowable change in
pressure, the pipe sizes of the manifold were manipulated manually. Since there is no
elevation difference along the manifold, friction is the only cause of pressure loss. The
pipe I.D. is a major component of friction, so adjusting the pipe sizes changes the friction
loss along the manifold, and the sum of friction losses makes up the actual change of
pressure. This can be seen in Table 6, where the pipe I.D. changes once friction becomes
too great.

Additionally, the manifold was sized so that the average pressure in the manifold is equal
to the target lateral inlet pressure. This was done in Excel using the “goal seek” command
– the Point P column values were changed by setting the Paverage cell equal to 29.30 psi.
After all manifolds were sized, the different pipe sizes and their total lengths were
recorded.
Mainline Sizing. Unlike the manifolds, which were designed based on DU, the mainline
was designed based on economics. This means that the line was sized so that it uses the
smallest pipe possible without the water exceeding a velocity of five feet per second. The
velocity of the pipe can be determined by dividing the flow rate in the pipe by the area of
the pipe. By doing this, it lowers the chance of water hammer in the pipe, as well as
lowers pumping costs (high velocity means more friction, resulting in more pressure loss
and more required pressure at the pump). However, in the case of the pecan block, the
mainline was sized based on the walnut block, because the mainline must deliver water to
both the pecan and walnut blocks. So, even though a smaller pipe size could have been
chosen to deliver water to the pecans, 6” pipe was chosen because it still had to deliver
water downstream to the walnuts. It is true that 5” pipe could have been chosen instead of
6”, but 5” pipe is not commonly used and may not be readily available. The tables below
were used to size the mainline.

Filtration Requirements. The filtration system was designed for the worst-case scenario,
and since the water supply comes from both a well and ditch, the filtration was designed
to handle the surface water contaminants. This design requires media tanks to sufficiently
filter the moderately dirty water. A common rule of thumb is to remove all particles
larger than 1/7th the microsprinkler orifice diameter. Since the orifice diameter is 0.06
inches, the maximum particle size that should pass filtration is 0.0086 inches, or 0.218
mm. However, it states in the JAIN technical brochure that the required filtration for all
2005 AquaMaster nozzles is 120 mesh. Therefore, 120 mesh will be used, even though an
80 mesh filter would properly filter a 0.218 mm particle. The correlation between particle
size and mesh number can be seen in the table below.

Sizing the Media Tanks. Table 45 in the literature by Burt and Styles (2011) recommends
the number and size of tanks based on the system flow rate and water quality. For the
sake of this design, the tanks were designed for a "moderate dirt load". Considering the

27
system will use surface water, some may suggest using a “moderate heavy dirt load”
instead. However, because the orchard is located on the east side of the Central Valley
between Visalia and Exeter, the surface water has low debris levels. This is because it is
closer to the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, so the water has not picked up debris that is
seen in canals further west. So, a “moderate dirt load” is sufficient. All three sets that will
run in the system were designed so that they all require a similar total flow rate, between
225-250 GPM. Since the flow rate and water quality were both known, the number and
size of the media tanks was easy to find.
TDH Required. The Total Dynamic Head is the amount of pressure that is required at the
pump – in this case, the booster pump directly downstream of the ditch inlet. It is
important to have a pump that can supply enough pressure to the entire system at all
times. In order to find the TDH required, all forms of pressure in the field must be
accounted for. This includes: the pressure required at the heads of manifolds plus the loss
due to friction in the mainline, the pressure loss through the filter tanks when most dirty,
the loss through the emergency filter screen, and minor losses. Any inlet pressure to the
pump would help lower the TDH, but in this case there is no inlet pressure due to an open
discharge.
The pressure required at the head of the manifold is the pressure at which the pressure
regulator will be set; this ensures the manifolds receive a consistent pressure. This
pressure, plus the losses due to friction in the mainline, is higher for the walnut block
than the pecan block. A typical value of friction loss through a well-designed filtration
system is 7.0 psi when the tanks are most dirty. It is also assumed that the loss through
the emergency filter screen is 0.5 psi. Minor losses include check valves, risers, fittings,
pressure regulators, etc. It is assumed that the minor losses in the system will equal 6.0
psi. The TDH is the sum of all of these forms of pressure.

28
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Crop Selection
After comparing the crops that potentially could be planted, the landowner decided that it
is best to select pecans; this was decided for three reasons. The first reason pecans were
selected is because it allows the landowner to continue with the same farm manager. The
two sides have a good relationship, and the farm manager manages both walnut and
pecan orchards. The second reason is that pecan trees are readily available and in close
proximity to the orchard. Since the trees are already located at the Blain Shop, the
landowner does not need to contact a nursery to buy seedlings, which is convenient. The
trees at that spot are approximately 80% Wichita and 20% Western Schley (used as
pollinator) with Shoshone rootstocks. Lastly, and most importantly, selecting pecans
allows the landowner to not worry about nematodes. After reviewing literature, it appears
that nematodes have little to no effect on pecan trees, but can be detrimental to young
walnut trees without proper management. By selecting pecans, the landowner can avoid
fallowing the land, fumigating, and losing several years’ worth of production.
Replanting Process
The selection of a replanting process has yet to be determined by the landowner. The two
options are to plant the 24 acres with pecans via the “transplanting” method or a
“traditional” method. The farm manager is performing a trial transplant on a separate
orchard at the end of 2016, so the decision of the landowner will be influenced by those
results. That being said, there are great benefits to the “transplanting” method on paper.
After completing an income/cost spreadsheet, the landowner is able to compare the cash
revenues of the two different methods over a nine-year period. This spreadsheet can be
seen in Appendix D.
The “traditional” method, where the pecan trees are planted when they are at year 0 (in
early 2018), has an accumulative deficit of $308,841 after nine years. The first profitable
year does not occur until year nine, and the payback period extends for several more
years.
The “transplanting” method, where the pecan trees are planted when they are at year 3 (in
early 2018), has an accumulative profit of $45,159 after nine years. The first profitable
year occurs in year six, and the payback period, when the initial investment pays itself
off, is between the eighth and ninth years.
It is true that the costs and incomes on this spreadsheet are all hypothetical and are
dependent on many variables, but the spreadsheet does a good job of showing the
potential benefits of planting via “transplanting”. The costs to plant, farm, and harvest the
trees are the same, but the overall replanting process is essentially accelerated three years
through transplanting, and the payback period is shorter. Keep in mind that the
“traditional” method of planting pecans is still a better option than doing a “traditional”
planting of walnuts, because walnut trees at year 0 would not be able to be planted until,

29
maybe, 2021 because of a potential nematode infestation. So, if the landowner chooses to
plant the 24 acres in 2018 with pecans via the “transplanting” method instead of doing a
“traditional” planting of walnuts in 2021, it would essentially accelerate the replanting
process by six years!
Irrigation System Design
Field and Micro Sprinkler Constraints. The constraints for the existing Chandler walnut
block include 27 foot tree spacing down rows and 32 foot tree spacing between rows.
There are 34 trees per row when rows are full; there is 0% slope between and down rows,
and 100% of the field consists of Grangeville sandy loam soil.
The constraints for the pecan block include 30 foot tree spacing down rows and 35 foot
tree spacing between rows. There are 31 trees per row when rows are full; there is 0%
slope between and down rows, and 100% of the field consists of Grangeville sandy loam
soil.
When looking at the overall field, including both walnut and pecan blocks, there is 350
GPM available to the system at one time, from either the well pump or the inlet from the
ditch at the NE corner of the field. The pressure provided by the well pump is zero due to
the open discharge into the standpipe feeding the pipeline. Another constraint is that the
landowner would prefer to not irrigate between the hours of 12:00-6:00 pm due to keep
power costs to a minimum, as those hours are peak hours and have a more expensive rate
of electricity use. Also, the landowner would like to achieve a 90% wetted area when
irrigating.
One constraint for the microsprinklers is that the orifice size of the emitter should be
greater than 0.04 inches; this helps avoid plugging. Also, the spaghetti hose to supply the
microsprinklers from the hose will be a length of five feet, which allows some flexibility
on the exact location of the microsprinkler between trees. Lastly, the system is designed
to have a global DU of 0.92 without using pressure regulators at the head of each hose.
Determine Peak ET. The peak ET rate for both walnuts and pecans falls in the month of
July. The peak rate for walnuts is 8.81 inches per month, or 1.99 inches per week, or 0.28
inches per day. The peak rate for pecans is 10.57 inches per month, or 2.39 inches per
week, or 0.34 inches per day.
Estimate GPH/Tree Needed. For the walnut block, the estimated flow rate per tree is
35.01 GPH when irrigated 36 hours per week. The irrigation scheduling is the choice of
the landowner, but irrigating 18 hours per day, two days per week, allows the landowner
to avoid irrigating during peak electricity usage hours, thereby lowering pumping costs.
For the pecan block, the estimated flow rate per tree is 15.31 GPH when irrigated 120
hours per week. Since the walnuts are irrigated two days out of the week during peak ET
rates, there are five days remaining to irrigate the pecans. As mentioned in the Procedures
section, running the pecan block only during off-peak hours (80 hours – 16 hours per day,
five days per week) makes the required system flow rate greater than the maximum flow

30
rate provided by the pump. So, operating hours will need to be extended into peak
electrical usage hours during peak ET rates.
120 hours means the pecans will have to be irrigated 24 hours per day, five days per week
during peak ET rates. Even though one of the constraints was to avoid irrigating between
12:00-6:00 pm, it was decided that it is better to have the pecans irrigated 24 hours per
day to accommodate pump flow constraints. Peak ET rates only occur one month out of
the year, meaning the field does not require as many hours of irrigation in the other
eleven months, so the landowner is willing to pump 24 hours per day for the month of
July. He is willing to make this sacrifice because irrigating 120 hours per week during
peak times allows the pecan blocks to use the same nozzle type as the walnut block,
where 100 hours results in a different nozzle type. Additionally, irrigating 120 hours per
week results in similar total flows (225-245 GPM) required by the walnut and pecan sets,
which is less than the well pump flow rate. Even though this seems like overkill, one
must remember that additional flow is required by the system when backflushing occurs,
which will be discussed when sizing tanks.
Estimate Number of Micro Sprinklers/Tree. There will be one microsprinkler per tree on
both the pecan and walnut blocks. One microsprinkler is capable of providing close to a
90% wetted area for both pecan and walnut spacing, so only one is needed. Even though
the wetted diameter of the microsprinkler may not provide the exact area to make a 90%
wetted area, it is a trade-off that the landowner is willing to make since the
microsprinkler provides the correct depth of water, which is most crucial.
Select the Proper Microsprinkler & Number of Sets. For the walnuts, a JAIN 2005
AquaMaster microsprinkler with a green swivel and an orange nozzle was selected. There
is only set when irrigating the walnut block, so it is all irrigated at the same time for 36
hours per week during peak ET rates. This microsprinkler is capable of supplying the
walnuts with the proper depth of water and wetted area – with just one sprinkler per tree
– all at a reasonable pressure of 34.7 psi. So, the microsprinklers will provide 35.01 GPH
when operating at 34.7 psi. This is seen as feasible, since the JAIN technical brochure
recommends the operating pressure of their microsprinklers be between 20-35 psi for best
results.
For the pecans, the same microsprinkler, swivel, and nozzle types were selected. There
are two sets when irrigating the pecan block, which means each sprinkler will operate
half the time. And, since they are operating half the time, they need double the flow rate.
The reason two sets were selected is because the needed flow rate per tree was too small
to provide close to a 90% wetted area when irrigated 120 hours per week. By splitting
this time in half, the sprinklers can operate at twice the flow, which will provide a better
wetted area. However, the entire block could not be operated 60 hours per week at twice
the flow, because the pump can only provide 350 GPM, which is not enough to supply
the entire block. So, by creating two sets, half of the 24 acres of pecans will run for 60
hours at a desired flow rate and pressure, and the other half will do the same at a different
time. This is why the mainline is positioned so that the pecan block is cut in half, 12 acres
on each side. The estimated flowrate per tree for the pecans was 15.31 GPH when

31
irrigating 120 hours per week, but since there are two sets, each microsprinkler will
provide 30.62 GPH when operating at 26.5 psi.
Locate and Position Manifolds, Determine Hose Sizes. Since the slope of the field is 0%,
the manifolds would be placed in the middle of the blocks if they were squarely shaped.
However, for the walnuts, it was decided that the length of the field is too long for one
manifold to supply the entire block, so there are two manifolds. Since there are two
manifolds, and no slope, the manifolds would be placed 1/4th and 3/4th of the length of the
field so they supply an even amount of trees. But, due to the neighbor’s lot in the SW, the
western manifold had to be moved east. The eastern manifold is located so that there is
230 feet of lateral on each side of the manifold, but the western manifold is located so
that there is the 185 feet of lateral to the east and 275 feet to the west. Drawings of these
locations, along with proper dimensions, make this easier to understand. This drawing
can be located in Appendix B.
The hose size was determined using the manifold placement program from the ITRC, and
it was found that the ideal size is 1.06” polyethylene hose. This is because it offers a
lower inlet pressure than smaller hoses (due to less friction loss), and offers the same DU
as larger hoses, which are more expensive. The inlet pressure to the hose for the walnuts
is 37.70 psi.
For the pecans, there was a similar issue with the boundary – Mill Creek, which runs on
the north edge of the pecan block. Since the distance from the first tree to last tree will
(these trees are not planted yet) be 900 feet, the manifolds should each supply water to
450 feet of lateral and they should be 450 feet apart (1/4th, 3/4th of the length of the field).
Since there are two sets, there are four manifolds – two manifolds per set. However, due
to the terrain, the manifolds had to be moved. The eastern manifolds are located so that
there is 214 feet of lateral to the east and 236 feet to the west. Notice that the manifolds
still supply 450 feet worth of lateral. The western manifolds are located so that there are
207 feet to the east and 243 feet to the west. Although the southern manifolds did not
need to be moved as the northern ones did, it was seen as convenient to have their inlets
be located on the same row.
The same hose size is used for the pecan block, 1.06” polyethylene hose. The inlet
pressure to the hose is 29.30 psi. In both cases the hose DU is 0.97, meaning the manifold
DU must be 0.95 to ensure a global DU of 0.92.
Determine the Allowable Change in Pressure. To ensure that the manifold DU meets its
requirements, the allowable change in pressure along a manifold was found. For the
walnuts, the allowable ΔP is 6.97 psi. For the pecans, the allowable ΔP is 5.33 psi.
Manifold Sizing. There are a total of six manifolds – two for the walnut block, and four
for the pecan block. As mentioned in the Procedures section, the pecan manifolds were
sized so they get as close to the allowable change in pressure without exceeding it, which
lowers installation cost by using smaller pipe but still meets the target system design DU
(0.92). The walnut manifolds, on the other hand, were sized to experience as little change

32
in pressure as possible, in order to lower the input pressure at the head of the manifold (at
the pressure regulator). This was done to close the gap between the different operating
pressures, as the walnut manifolds require more pressure than the pecan manifolds, so
that the TDH required for the different sets is more similar. The exact manifold pipe
I.D.’s and their lengths can be seen in the irrigation design spreadsheets, located in
Appendix C. The walnut manifolds consist of 3 inch and 4 inch nominal IPS PVC pipe
sizes, and the pecan manifolds consist of 2 inch and 3 inch nominal IPS PVC pipe sizes.
Note that the pipe sizes of the pecan manifolds are smaller, which attributes to the larger
change in pressure due to friction.
Mainline Sizing. The mainline was sized based on economics (as opposed to DU which
was used downstream of the pressure regulator) so that the velocity in the pipe does not
exceed five feet per second. The mainline has a total length of 2,350 feet, and will run
from the well pump, split the pecan block in half, and then dogleg south before finishing
at the western manifold in the walnut block. Because the flow rate between the walnut
manifolds is much less than the flow upstream of the eastern walnut manifold (more than
half the flow rate outlets at the eastern manifold), the pipe size in that section did not
need to be as large. Therefore, 4 inch nominal IPS PVC pipe is used in this section. It is
true that 3 inch pipe could be used because the velocity would be less than five feet per
second, but the manifold begins with 4 inch pipe, so it makes sense to use 4 inch pipe.
The rest of the mainline, from the eastern walnut manifold to the well, consists of 6 inch
nominal IPS PVC pipe. Even though the pecan block does not need such a large diameter
pipe, the 6 inch pipe still has to supply the walnut block with water, and the larger pipe
will minimize pressure loss, again so the pump discharge pressure is similar when either
the walnuts or the pecans are being irrigated.
Filtration Requirements. After determining the mesh size to be used and the maximum
particle size that passes, the media to be used in the sand media tanks was selected from
the table in the procedures section. The media that will be used is #11 Crushed Granite.
Sizing the Media Tanks. The number and size of the media tanks was selected based on
the flow rate of the system and the water quality. Normally, for a system with a big
difference in flows between different sets, the tanks are sized based on the set with the
highest flow rate. Luckily, since all three sets operate at a similar flow rate, the tank
sizing will be the same for all sets. The recommended filter station contains three 30”
media tanks. However, since one tank does not filter during backflush, it is beneficial to
have an additional tank for proper filtration. Therefore, four 30” media tanks will be
used.
It is important to note that the required backflush flow rate for a 30” media tank is 80
GPM (Burt and Styles, 2011). So, when backflushing occurs, the system requires an
additional 80 GPM to what the field needs. The largest flow rate required at one time in
the field is 245 GPM; this occurs when irrigating the Northern part of the pecan block.
So, when backflushing occurs during this irrigation event, the well pump will need to
provide 325 GPM to the pipeline (245 + 80 GPM). Since it was assumed the maximum

33
flow rate from the pump is 350 GPM, this design ensures that the required system flow
rate does not exceed the flow rate provided by the well pump.
TDH Required. Since the different sets operate at different pressures, the booster pump
that will be used must be sized for the set with the highest pressure. For the walnuts, the
TDH required is 52.98 psi. For the pecans, the TDH is 45.98 psi. Therefore, a booster
pump that is capable of pressurizing the system at approximately 53 psi should be
installed.

Miscellaneous. In addition to the parts and materials that were mentioned in the irrigation
system design, the system needs several other components in order to be completed and
ready to operate. For example, the filtration system is not simply three 30” sand media
tanks – the tanks requires additional parts to ensure that the water is filtered properly. A
sight tube, two air vents, an emergency screen, and a flow control valve – for the
backflush line – are also needed on a filter station. There may be additional components
that are needed as well. A representation of these components in the system can be seen
in the drawings in Appendix C.
If chemigation is to take place, it is necessary that two check valves be installed. One
check valve must be located on the chemical line upstream of the injection point – this
prevents water in the pipeline from flowing into the chemical tank. Another check valve
must be installed upstream of the injection point and downstream of the booster pump –
this prevents injected water from flowing back into the pump upon turnoff. In addition to
the check valve, the “chemigation” valve also contains an air vent and a low pressure
drain, which are directly upstream of the check valve.

34
Multiple air vents are required on the system. In addition to the air vents on the filter
station, the system needs air vents at the head of each manifold. In fact, it needs two air
vents at each head – one upstream of the pressure regulator, to release air continuously
and when the system is pressurizing, and one downstream of the pressure regulator, to
allow air into the pipe when water exits. In total, the orchard requires two air vents at
every manifold connection, two on the filter station, one at the chemigation valve, one at
every flushout, and two at the butterfly valve between the walnut and pecan blocks.
The system also requires flushouts on the end of every manifold line and one at the end
of the mainline. The diameter of the flushout should be atleast half the diameter of the
manifold pipe. The flushouts help to remove solids and settled debris from the system.
There also needs to be pressure relief valves to ensure the pressure in the pipe does not
become over-pressurized. There should be one located directly downstream of the booster
pump and upstream of a manual valve, and another located at the end of the mainline
before the flushout.

35
RECOMMENDATIONS
All of the data tables and drawings that were made were intended to aid the landowner in
his decision making for the replanting of the orchard, not give him a single option. The
ideas that were presented in this report are simply one scenario of replanting the orchard,
but it is not to say there are other options. However, this report does show the benefits
that will be seen if the landowner chooses to plant pecans, plant them via “transplanting”,
and install the proposed irrigation system. The proposed irrigation system does not
suggest that the orchard will conserve water, but it does suggest that very similar amounts
of water will be made available to all trees in the field. Because of this high DU, the trees
are more likely to experience more uniform yields, and potentially higher yields if the
system is run properly.
If the landowner does choose to implement the options given in this report, there are still
some loose ends that need to be addressed. One issue that needs to be resolved is the flow
rate entering the system. The highest flow rate at one time that is required by the system
is 245 GPM, but during backflush the required flow rate will be 325 GPM; the well pump
discharges more in the range of 350 GPM, and this number can vary depending on
groundwater levels. So, to ensure that there is not excess flow causing the standpipe to
overflow, the landowner has a few options. One option is to install a VFD on the
electrical motor of the well pump, but the landowner would like to avoid this due to the
high installation cost and added electrical inefficiencies.
Another option is to build a reservoir. A reservoir would allow water to be stored so that
the system can be running without the well pump running 24/7 during times of peak ET,
assuming no surface water is available. An automated system could be installed so that
the well pump kicks on when a minimum level is reached in the reservoir, and turns off
when the maximum level is reached. A benefit of this idea is that the system could
receive the correct flow rate (with a proper flow control valve) and the well pump would
not need to run continuously. Another benefit is that it allows both well and surface water
to be used without having to throttle the output from the well pump, since the reservoir
regulates the available water to the booster pump. It also provides a place to backflush
water and recycle it, so any additional flow for backflushing will be reused. A
disadvantage of this idea is that the reservoir would take the place of land where extra
trees could be planted, and the installation cost of the system would increase.
If the reservoir is sized to have 8250 gallons of live storage, the well pump should never
have to turn on more than one time per hour. This size can be created with several
different combinations of length, width, and height, but it should be constructed so that
the maximum level in the reservoir is the same elevation as the maximum water level in
the ditch. The reservoir water level will float with the ditch water level when surface
water is available. The minimum water level will need to be above the booster pump
intake accounting for proper submergence to prevent vortexing. More information on the
reservoir can be seen at the bottom of the pecan irrigation system design spreadsheet in
Appendix C.

36
An alternative to building a reservoir is to throttle the discharge of the well pump with a
throttle valve. This could not be done manually because the required flow rate of the
system changes when backflush is initiated. It is not feasible to have a person open/close
the valve every time backflush occurs. Instead, a float that connects to the throttle valve
could be installed in the standpipe. The float would move up/down depending on the
water level in the pipeline, and it would in turn open/close the throttle valve until the
ideal flow is reached. A good source of information for this idea can be found on the
ITRC website, where there is a report by Franklin Gaudi titled “Evaluation and
Modification of a Float Valve for the Delano-Earlimart Irrigation District”. A benefit of
this idea is that it is a low installation cost. A disadvantage of this idea is that while the
throttle valve lowers the flow rate, it also increases TDH by burning pressure through the
valve, which increases annual pumping costs.

Figure 6. Photo of existing well pump station at Bricker Farms.
If the system is being fed via surface water, the ditch turnout valve should be opened so
the incoming flow matches the required flow of the system. Therefore, in addition to the
existing flow meter on the well discharge pipe, a flow meter should be installed
downstream of the inlet from the ditch. The meter would help the landowner know that
flow entering the system from the ditch matches what is desired. If a reservoir is used, the
well pump will never have to be used to compensate for the additional flow for
backflushing, because the backflush flow water will be recycled back into the reservoir. It
may be a good idea to check that the capacity of the ditch inlet matches the maximum
required flow rate by the system.

37

Figure 7. Photo of the existing Oaks Ditch turnout at Bricker Farms.
Once the optimal flow rate is achieved, the system also needs to be properly pressurized.
Therefore, as mentioned in the results, a booster pump should be installed upstream of the
filter station. The booster pump must be able to add approximately 53 psi of pressure to
the system when irrigating the walnut block. Since the landowner does not want to deal
with a VFD, the booster pump will supply this 53 psi to the pipeline when irrigating the
pecans, even though it only require 46 psi. This is alright – the extra pressure will be
burned off at the pressure regulator, which would be set at approximately 32 psi. The
landowner should choose a pump that features a pump curve that has a high efficiency in
the neighborhood of 240 GPM and a TDH of 122 feet (or 53 psi). Additionally, it would
be ideal to select a pump with a flat system curve, so the pressure does not decrease
dramatically during backflush.

APPENDIX A
How Project Meets Requirements for the ASM Major

41
Major Design Experience
The BRAE senior project must incorporate a major design experience. The design
process usually involves the fundamental elements as outlined below.
Establishment of Objectives and Criteria. Project objectives and criteria are
established to meet the needs of Bricker Farms.
Synthesis and Analysis. The project analyzed the potential economic impacts of
different planting techniques, and payback periods associated with them.
Construction, Testing, and Evaluation. This project will be designed to meet the needs
of Bricker Farms. There will be no testing done on this project.
Incorporation of Applicable Engineering Standards. The system was designed based
on strategies and requirements described in Burt and Styles (2011). Additionally, Soil
Surveys were conducted through programs provided by the NRCS.
Capstone Project Experience. The project will incorporate many concepts that were
introduced in previous engineering classes. The project will also utilize many concepts
that had to be researched further. The relevant classes include: BRAE 151 AutoCAD, 321
Ag Safety, 340 Irrigation Water Management, 438 Drip/Micro Irrigation, 418/419 Ag
Systems Management, 532 Water Wells and Pumps, ENGL 145 Reasoning,
Argumentation and Writing, SS 121 Introductory Soil Science.
Design Parameters and Constraints. This project addresses a significant number of the
categories of constraints listed below.
Physical. The replanting of the orchard relies heavily on Mother Nature; if weather is not
cooperative, the entire design and lead-up could be worthless.
Economic. The land owner wishes to limit the costs as much as possible; this is why the
transplant method of replanting is a serious consideration.
Environmental. A huge factor in the decision on which crop to replant is the
environmental impact on the land. Replanting walnuts would require a significant amount
of fumigation, which has negative environmental effects.
Ergonomical. N/A
Manufacturability. The new irrigation system must be designed so that all
manufacturing and installation are feasible and can be completed with ease.
Health and Safety. The transplant replanting method must be completed in a way that
does not place the equipment operator in harm’s way.

42
Ethical. The system was designed to meet peak evapotranspiration demands and
pipelines were sized based on engineering standards to ensure high DU and economic
considerations. Pipeline protection (air vents, pressure sustaining valves, etc.) was also
added to the system.
Political. Improving irrigation to potentially assist in the groundwater sustainability plan
that Governor Brown has set forth; determining if it is correct to replant trees in a time of
drought.
Productivity. The objective when choosing irrigation systems and crops is to maximize
profits in the future.

*This design is for a sandy loam so the additional water will go about 0.75 ft beyond the radius of throw of the
microsprinkler, adding 1.5 ft to the diameter - this would supposedly occur below the soil surface; rough estimate only.
*The system is to be designed for a wetted soil volume of 90% or greater.

90% wetted area =
777.6 sq. ft

Reduce the diameter by 1.5 ft due to sandy loam spreading.
Diameter of microsprayer =

The radius of throw for a 2005 AquaMaster Green Swivel will be adequate for the needed diamter for most pressure selections.
Therefore, use one microsprayer per tree.
4) Select the proper microsprayer and number of sets.
The above calculation of flow rate per tree assumed all of the emitters operated at the same time. If there are two sets
the flow rate per microsprayer will be doubled because a single microsprayer would only operate half of the time.

1 set is selected because:
* The pressure is reasonable. The recommended working pressures for the 2005 AquaMaster microsprinkler are from 20 to 35 psi
** the operating time is ideal for the orchard when irrigated in one set. Since the 24 acres of pecans on the orchard will
also need to be irrigated, this allows the entire walnut block to be irrigated separately at once , two days out of the week.
*** The yellow nozzle also operates at a working pressure when there are two sets, but this results in much too large of a wetted diameter.
**** The orange nozzle delivers a wetted diameter of 29.5 ft when operating at 29 psi, so it will be
slightly larger at a higher pressure, resulting in atleast 90% wetted area.

5) Locate positions of the manifolds via the Manifold location program
The pressure regulation strategy that has been defined for this step does not allow individual pressure regulators at the
start of each hose, nor does it need PC emitters to be used (due to the level field). The allowable pressures difference
downstream of the "PR" point includes pressure differences along the manifold and the pressure differences along the
hoses.
Minimum Allowable System DU = Manifold DU x Single Hose DU
Because the required new system DU must be better than 0.92, the DU of a single hose must be considerably better than
that, which will allow for some pressure differences along the manifold.

920 ft is used instead of 891 ft because often microsprinklers are located on the outside edges of the field. A typical hose
length is commonly between 200 ft and 300 ft. The actual length of hose accounting for tree spacing will be approximately
460 ft. 2 manifolds will give an approximate 230 ft hose uphill and downhill.
*However, since the neighbors lot in the SW corner extends more than 230 ft (it extends 275 ft), the west
manifold will be placed so there is 185 ft uphill and 275 ft downhill (10 trees downhill, 7 uphill). The southernmost 4 rows will not have any downhill emitters, only 7 emitters uphill.
In a commercial design, one might examine the costs for 2, 3, and 4 manifolds per set and then make a selection based on DU, cost,
the benefits of more or fewer valves in the field, etc., but this example just examines 2 manifolds.

The manifold must be installed midway between adjacent trees in a row. Therefore, the first (East) manifold must be
trenched after the 8th tree, meaning there are 8 trees uphill of the first manifold, and 9 trees downhill. Both manifolds
supply 17 trees. The second (West) manifold should be placed so that it has 7 trees uphill and 10 trees downhill, due to
the neighbors' lot. The manifolds will be 420' apart.

The pipe should be sized to maintain a velocity less than 4.5 feet per second
Minimum pipe size we can use:

4.28 inches (ID) from max pipe on Manifold
5.40 feet per second
Vel =

(GPM/449)/(3.14*((Pipe ID/12in/ft)/2)^2)

If velocity is not less than 4.5 fps, change the pipe ID to another value from table above.
Therefore, the mainline will be a minimum of 5" Nominal PVC pipe.

9) Filtration Requirements
The filtration system must be designed for the worst situation and since the water supply comes from both a well and ditch the filtration must
be designed to handle the surface water contaminants. This design requires media tanks to sufficiently filter the moderately dirty water.
**A common rule of thumb is to remove all particles larger than 1/7th the microsprinkler orifice diameter.

10) Size the media tanks
The total flow rate:

242.05 gpm

Table 45 in the book (pg 207) recommends the number and size of tanks based on the system flow rate and water quality.
For the sake of this design, the tanks will be designed for a "moderate dirt load".

Flow rate

Moderate Dirt Load
175 - 275 gpm

Number & size of tanks
3 - 30" tanks

4 30" media tanks with #8 Crushed Granite Media will be used to filter this system.
4 will be used instead of 3 because it will help filtration during backflush, as one of the tanks does not filter during backflush.
11) Estimation of pressure loss when filters are dirty.
A typical value of friction loss through a well designed filtration system is 7.0 psi ( with some media
filters having good underdrains and valves, this can be reduced ).

* minor losses include: check valves, set valves, risers, pressure regulators, elbows, etc. One should always check with the specific
valve manufacturer to determine as many valve loss components as possible.
**Considering the well pump and ditch turnout have no inlet pressure (they discharge into an open stand pipe), a booster pump
must be installed between the well pump/ditch turnout and the filter station. The booster pump should be able to add
approximately 53 psi of pressure to the pipeline.

*This design is for a sandy loam so the additional water will go about 0.75 ft beyond the radius of throw of the microsprinkler,
adding 1.5 ft to the diameter - this would supposedly occur below the soil surface; rough estimate only.
*The system is to be designed for a wetted soil volume of 90% or greater.
90% wetted area =
945 sq. ft
Diameter that provides this =
34.7 ft.
Reduce the diameter by 1.5 ft due to sandy loam spreading.
Diameter of microsprayer =
33.2 sq. ft
The radius of throw for a 2005 AquaMaster Green Swivel will be adequate for the needed diameter for most pressure selections.
Therefore, use one microsprayer per tree.

54
4) Select the proper microsprayer and number of sets.
The above calculation of flow rate per tree assumed all of the emitters operated at the same time. If there are two sets the
flow rate per microsprayer will be doubled because a single microsprayer would only operate half of the time.

these microsprinklers.

2 sets are selected because:
* The pressure is reasonable. The recommended working pressures for the 2005 AquaMaster microsprinkler are from 20 to 35 psi
** the operating time is ideal for the orchard when irrigated in two sets. Since the walnuts will also need to be irrigated two days per
week, this allows the pecan block (which must operate 120 hrs/week) to be runs in two sets - half will run for 24 hrs/day, 2.5 days/week,
and the other half will run for 24 hrs/day, 2.5 days/week. Therefore, the pump will operate 18 hrs/day for 2 days/week, and 24 hrs/day
for 5 days/week in order to supply the entire orchard with enough water during times of peak ET c rates.
*** The orange nozzle delivers a wetted diameter of 29.5 ft when operating at 29 psi, so it will be slightly
smaller at a lower pressure, still resulting in close to a 90% wetted area.

5) Locate positions of the manifolds via the Manifold location program
The pressure regulation strategy that has been defined for this step does not allow individual pressure regulators at the start
of each hose, nor does it allow PC emitters to be used. The allowable pressures difference downstream of the "PR" point
includes pressure differences along the manifold and the pressure differences along the hoses.
Minimum Allowable System DU = Manifold DU x Single Hose DU
Because the required new system DU must be better than 0.92, the DU of a single hose must be considerably better than that,
which will allow for some pressure differences along the manifold.

900 ft is used because microsprinklers are located on the outside edges of the field, and the outside sprinklers on each
manifold are 450 ft apart. A typical hose length is commonly between 200 ft and 300 ft. 2 manifolds will give an approximate
225 ft hose uphill and downhill, but due to the irregular shape from the creek the East manifolds will be placed 214 ft from the
edge, or uphill, with 236 ft downhill (East --> West = downhill). The West manifold will have 207 ft uphill and 243 ft downhill.
Due to the main line location, there will actually be 4 manifolds (one East and one West manifold North of the main line, and one East
and one West manifold South of the mainline). The Southern manifolds will all have the same size laterals, but the Northern manifold's
laterals will change size due to the creek. That being said, there will still be 2 sets - the Southern manifolds will run at the same time, and
the Northern manifolds will run at the same time. The main line was placed so that the 24 acres of Pecans is cut in half as accurately as
possible, allowing the two sets to have similar flows.

* Inlet pressures are after the hose fittings
Choose:
1.06 inch ID hose. The 1.39 ID hose requires slightly less inlet
pressure, but cost more and has the same DU.
*Hose ID values taken from tubing sizes in JAIN technical brochure
The manifold must be installed midway between adjacent trees in a row. Therefore, the first (East) manifold must be trenched
after the 7th tree, meaning there are 8 emitters uphill of the first manifold, and 8 emitter downhill. The second (West)
manifold must be trenched after the 8th tree from the West, meaning there are 7 emitters uphill and 9 emitters downhill.
Both manifolds supply 16 trees, with the 16th tree being supplied by both manifolds. The manifolds will be 473' apart.

8) Mainline sizing
Mainline from well to the manifold will be designed to handle:

245.31 gpm

The pipe should be sized to maintain a velocity less than 4.5 feet per second
Minimum pipe size we can use:
Velocity of this pipe:

3.284 inches (ID) from max pipe on Manifold
9.29 feet per second
Vel =

(GPM/449)/(3.14*((Pipe ID/12in/ft)/2)^2)

If velocity is not less than 4.5 fps, change the pipe ID to another value from table above.
Therefore, the mainline will be a minimum of 5" Nominal PVC pipe.

** The pipe ID will be 6.301 because this is what is used to deliver water to the walnut trees, even though it is larger than needed for the sake of the pecans.
9) Filtration Requirements
The filtration system must be designed for the worst situation and since the water supply comes from both a well and ditch the filtration must be
designed to handle the surface water contaminants. This design requires media tanks to sufficiently filter the moderately dirty water. **A common
rule of thumb is to remove all particles larger than 1/7th the microsprinkler orifice diameter.
Maximum flow rate:
Orifice diameter:
Min. removed particle diameter:

=

It states in the JAIN technical brochure that the required filtration for all 2005 AquaMaster nozzles is 120 mesh. Therefore, 120 mesh will be used.

10) Size the media tanks
The total flow rate:

245.31 gpm

Table 45 in the book (pg 207) recommends the number and size of tanks based on the system flow rate and water quality. For
the sake of this design, the tanks will be designed for a "moderate dirt load".

Flow rate

Moderate Dirt Load
175 - 275 gpm

Number & size of tanks
3 - 30" tanks

4 30" media tanks with #11 Crushed Granite Media will be used to filter this system.
4 will be used instead of 3 because it will help filtration during backflush, as one of the tanks does not filter during backflush.
11) Estimation of pressure loss when filters are dirty.
A typical value of friction loss through a well designed filtration system is 7.0 psi ( with some media filters
having good underdrains and valves, this can be reduced ).

* minor losses include: check valves, set valves, risers, pressure regulators, elbows, etc. One should always check with the specific valve
manufacturer to determine as many valve loss components as possible.
**Considering the pump and ditch turnout have no inlet pressure (they discharge into an open stand pipe), a booster pump must be
installed between the well pump/ditch turnout and the filter station. The booster pump should be able to add approximately 53 psi of
pressure to the pipeline in order to supply the Chandler walnuts, so the same pump will be sufficient for the Pecans.

SIZING THE RESERVOIR
What is the general formula for required volume, given a pump GPM (P) and number of cycles/hr
(n)? Solve for the pool volume that would be needed to have only 1 pump start per hour,
maximum. Prove with the plug-and-chug method that you are correct.
