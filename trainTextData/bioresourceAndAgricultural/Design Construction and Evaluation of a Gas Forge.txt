ABSTRACT

This report covers the design, construction, and evaluation of a propane forge. The
purpose for building this propane forge was to replace an old charcoal forge in order to
improve upon certain points of performance such as adjustability of heat, portability, and
fuel cost by being able to run the forge for any amount of time with an easy on/off
control. The design of this forge consisted of a steel pipe body insulated with ceramic
fiber blanket, and was heated by a single atmospheric burner.

INTRODUCTION

Since the beginning of time, man has found the need to use tools to help him
accomplish his work. One of the first tools was the blade. Starting from crude
elements, man found better ways to make the blades that met societal needs
along with advances in technology. Through the ages, the materials and quality
of man’s blades increased. For many centuries, man relied on the edged
weapon as a means of survival from daily life to warfare. From the Japanese
Katana to the American Bowie knife, the blade has become a historical and
iconic piece for civilizations as well as a unique art form among people as is seen
in Figure1 below. While the process of forging a blade has changed over the
course of history, man’s need for the blade has not diminished any.

Figure 1. Blacksmiths Using Archaic Forge (blackiron.us).
To create a hardened blade that can withstand repeated use and hold an edge,
knife makers temper and heat treat the blade. To harden the blade, it must be
heated to a high temperature then quickly cooled in a liquid. The process of
heating a blade takes place in a forge. A forge is a device that can harbor an
environment of extreme heat by providing and containing a concentrated heat
source. Forges use various methods to provide the heat.
Ashton Davis currently uses a homemade charcoal forge to make knives and
metalwork. His current forge consists of a cast iron pot which is filled with coals,
and air-fed by an air compressor through a PVC pipe. The problems with coal
and charcoal forges are that they cannot easily be turned off or on, the

2

temperature is difficult to control, and poor quality charcoal can adversely affect
the blades by causing impurities. By switching to a propane powered forge,
those problems would be eliminated by allowing it to easily be turned off or on,
being able to control the gas flow, and eliminating the possibility of poor quality
charcoal. Propane heat is still able to reach forge welding temperatures so the
capabilities of the forge are not diminished. The project is to design, build, and
test a propane forge that will improve the quality and ease of knife making over a
coal forge and is big enough to fit other tools such as hammers and hatchets for
forge work but can be lifted by a single man.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Research was conducted in order to examine existing methods for metalworking
for hobbyists. Much information regarding propane forges, including DIY guides
on making propane forges, can be found on the internet. There are numerous
videos, pictures, and articles describing relatively easy ways to construct
homemade propane forge. Information from a few articles will be compiled and
used for the final project plan. Propane is nearly twice as energy dense as coal
(see Tables 1 and 2 below) and charcoal energy density is usually around the
high values of coal given in Table 2.
As for composition of the forge itself, the main body can be a cylindrical piece of
steel. Dempsey (2005) claims that a body as thin as 14ga steel will work if
proper insulation is installed because it will not get too hot. A forge must be
heated by a burner, for which there are a couple of options to go with. From the
review, the RR type EZ burner has the ability to reach forge welding
temperatures without requiring a blower. This burner is recommended for sea
level areas, and is simple to construct from parts purchased at a local plumbing
store. This burner is said to be a good beginner burner and can be easily
replaced by a more advanced burner (adjustable) at a later time (Dempsey,
2005). The article also talks about the front and back of the forge and what to do
about retaining heat. Dempsey (2005) says that there should be a small hole in
the back so that long pieces can extend

Table 1. Propane Gas Properties (NFPA 1998).

4

through the opening and so that expanding hot gases have a place to escape.
For the front, it should be large and open, but have soft firebricks to stack and
close off the front to heat it up to retain heat. The rule of thumb for the vent is at
least seven times the cross sectional area of the burner.

Table 2. Coal Properties (Engineering ToolBox).
Another article described the need for fiber lining inside of the forge (Zoeller,
2012). The purpose of it is the keep as much heat within the forge as possible so
the heating process is as efficient as possible. There are a few options for
insulating the inside of the forge. One option is to use firebrick because it is
cheap, but it is also inefficient. Fabric lining is the ideal option because, while it
is more expensive, it holds heat much better. Kaowool is one option for the lining
that is very common in gas forge construction. From reviewing the specifications
of their products on the Morgan: Thermal Ceramics website, the Kaowool
ceramic fiber blankets are rated at 1,260 degrees C which is equal to 2,300
degrees F. The combustion temperature of propane is 1,967 degrees F for
combustion with air and 2,526 degrees for combustion with pure oxygen (The
Engineering ToolBox). Typical forge welding temperatures for a propane forge
are accepted as 2,300 degrees F, and common forging can be accomplished at a
lower temperature.
The body must be painted so that it will be protected from corrosion. From the
review of the products on Home Depot’s website, there are many paints that will
work for high heat applications, but one is easily obtainable and fits the
specifications. Rust-Oleum High Heat has a flat finish and will look nice and will
also protect the steel from rust and corrosion. The thing that paint must be able
to weather in this application is the heat that it will be subject to. For the outside
of the body of the forge, the paint will be subject only to the heat of the steel body
itself which is protected from direct contact with the flames by way of the wool
fabric refractory lining. The paint is rated for 2,000 degrees F which will be
sufficient heat resistance as the steel body of the forge should never get near
that temperature.

PROCEDURES AND METHODS

Design
Body. Because this project was meant to replace one device with a new, better
device, certain areas had to be focused on for the alteration. The first design
consideration was the main body of the apparatus. Since propane forges are
enclosed systems with the only openings being vents and access doors or
permanent openings, a body had to be created that would be big enough to fit
the pieces that would be forged as well as allow for insulation, but not be too big
where it could not be carried short distances or lifted chest high by one man.

Figure 2. Forge Design Drawing
The other consideration for main body size was the heating required for the
space. A rule of thumb in the forging industry is one EZ burner (the burner that
was ultimately chosen) per 350 cubic inches of space in the forge in order to
reach standard forging temperatures. This design ended up being 339 cubic

6

inches of The body that was chosen was a 10” ID schedule 40 steel pipe. This
was chosen because it was available, however in another instance where one
would have to be ordered a different choice may have been made. The body
also included two pieces of angle iron for stabilizers at the base of the forge
Insulation. To insulate the inside of the forge, 2” of ceramic fiber blanket
insulation was chosen because of its high resistance to extreme heat and its
workability in a round pipe. 2” was chosen because of the double effectiveness
of retaining the heat in the forge. While it cost more to add the extra layer, lower
fuel costs would make up the difference quickly. Like a car with good gas
mileage, it costs more to begin with, but requires less fuel to run. The same
concept applies with the forge because less heat is escaping the forge with better
insulation and the fuel is therefore used more efficiently. The additional cost of
installing the second layer of insulation would be $7.46 since the cost of the
blanket is $4.75 per square foot. The extra fuel cost without the second layer of
insulation is $0.18 per hour (refer to Appendix B). After 26 hours of operating the
forge, the second layer of insulation pays itself off and starts saving money.
Instead of a single roll of 2” thick fiber blanket, two 1” layers were used because
it is easier to work 1” layers in a round body than it is to work a 2” piece. In a box
shaped forge, firebricks probably would have been chosen because they are
cheaper than the fiber blanket and can easily be stacked during installation.
Firebricks also do not emit dangerous fiber particles in the air when the forge is
ran such as the fiber blanket does. For this design, a refractory coating called
ITC-100 was used to coat the entirety of the fiber blanket. The coating is a claylike substance that is painted on and dries. This was done because it helps keep
heat in the forge, but also because it seals the ceramic fibers that would be
otherwise harmful to the user of the forge. While the cost increased because of
the use of the expensive refractory coating, it was worth the expense because
the user would then be able to operate the forge without a respirator. To close
off the ends of the forge, the considerations were minimum ventilation and
access. The minimum ventilation required for an atmospheric burner like the one
that was chosen is at least seven times the area of the end of the burner. Since
the burner that was chosen had a 1.77 square inch nozzle, the minimum
ventilation required was 12.4 square inches. Because the nozzle was to be
made using non-precise methods, a safe 14 square inches was used.
Burner. Since this forge was to be propane powered as opposed to charcoal
heated, a fuel system had to be designed to deliver and burn the propane. The
main piece of this design was the burner. Many different types of burners are
available for propane forges, and there are many plans for making burners.

7

Burners can either be atmospherically aerated or blown. Atmospheric burners
rely on venturi shaped burners to draw air in to the high-velocity, low-pressure
streams of propane being injected into the forge.

Atmospheric burners work great at low elevations and do not require any
mechanisms to deliver the air. Blown burners rely on a compressor to force air
into the burner. Blown burners are better for high elevation applications due to
the thinner air at high elevations and the inability of atmospheric burners to
deliver the proper amount of air because of that. The downside to blown burners
is that they require another power source to run the compressor and therefore
limit the portability of the forge. For a shop forge there is no problem with that,
but for people that need to take their forge around with them for work (such as
farriers who go out to ranches and work out of the back of their truck), it does not
work quite so well. Because portability was a strong consideration, and the forge
was to be used at or near sea-level, the atmospheric burner was chosen.

8

Construction
Body. The first step was to build the main body of the forge which everything
else would attach to. To do this, a piece of steel had to be acquired large
enough for the type of jobs the forge would be to handle. A common body is an
old propane or Freon tank which results in a large, lightweight body but locating
these can be difficult. A 10” diameter pipe was used because it would only
require one burner for a 1’ length as opposed to an old propane tank which would
require two burners because of the extra 2” of diameter.

Figure 4. Cutting Body to Length
The pipe is much heavier than the tank would be, but also much sturdier. The
pipe was then cut to a length of 1’ in the band saw. The second step in
constructing the body of the forge was to build and attach the burner holder. The
burner holder was made out of a 2” diameter pipe section. The length of the pipe
was cut to 4” and then one end of the pipe was cut at a 45 degree angle. The

9

purpose of the angled end of the pipe is for when it is attached to the body. The
burner will heat up the forge best when it is at an angle inside the forge to create
a swirling effect around the inside. To create the hole where the burner holder
would go, the angled pipe section was held on the center of the body and traced
with a scratch awl. The hole was then cut out with an oxy-torch and a piece of
scrap sheet metal was placed inside the pipe to catch all of the molten metal to
assist with cleanup. A half-round file was used to clean up the hole and smooth
some angular edges so that the holder would fit well inside the hole.
Burner Holder. The burner holder was designed to have two sets of set screws
so that the angle of the burner inside could be finely adjusted. Each row would
have four set screws, so eight total holes had to be drilled into the burner holder.
To locate the lines where the holes would be placed, an initial line was placed
and then the others were measured off that one. The lines were to be offset to
create an “x” pattern as opposed to a “+” pattern. The first line was eyeballed
along one of the sides and scratched in using a square held onto the end of the
pipe (which was in a vice) and a scratch awl. The next lines were marked by
dividing the circumference by four and measuring each one along the edge of the
pipe. After the four lines were established, each hole was located by measuring
a prescribed distance from the edge of the pipe to the two holes along each line.
Once the centers were marked with the scratch awl, they were set with a center
punch. The pipe was then moved to the drill press to drill the holes. A pilot hole
was used for each one and then the drill size that would fit the weld nut was used
for the final hole.

The body was then clamped to the table with the cut hole on top. The body and
the burner holder were cleaned up with a wire wheel to provide a cleaner weld.
The burner holder was set at the desired angle then tacked into place with the
MIG welder. Since the hole was cut with the torch and imperfect, gaps had to be
filled with the welder. The MIG was then run around the burner holder in the hole
until it was secure. At that point, the nuts had to be welded onto the burner
holder. Each nut was hit with the wire wheel to remove the coating in preparation
for the welding. Each nut was welded on two sides with the MIG.
Handle. A handle for the forge was constructed from some rebar because it was
readily available. A piece of rebar was held in the vice and hammered with a
sledge hammer to form 90 degree bends. The excess material was cut off in the
band saw and then the handle was welded onto the top of the body with the MIG.

Figure 6. Rebar Handle Drawing
Feet. The feet of the forge were constructed from a piece of angle iron cut to
length on the band saw and then welded to the bottom of the forge body at the
point where the feet were flat and the forge body touched the ground in the
middle. The foot was welded on both sides to create distance between the two
welds so they could resist a bending moment.

11

Figure 7. Angle Iron Feet
Tool Rest. The tool rest was constructed by simply cutting a piece of rebar to
length and then bending it 90 degrees with a hammer and vice. The tool rest
attachment part was constructed by finding a small piece of pipe that could just fit
the rebar into it without too much slop, cutting it to length, and then drilling a hole
into the middle of it. The hole was sized so that the weld nut would fit and a bolt
could be tightened and loosened to adjust or remove the tool rest bar. The
attachment part was then welded onto the forge body flush with the face of the
pipe.

Burner
The burner was constructed using basic plumbing parts and a little machining.
For the air intake, the 1 ½” to ¾” galvanized bell reducer was marked a quarter
inch below the large opening along center and a 9/64” hole was drilled clear
through both sides. A hole was then drilled on only one side from the top face of
the reducer down into the previously drilled hole so that both holes intersected
each other. This hole was sized so that it could be tapped for an 1/4” NC bolt.
The original hole had to be filed with a small round file in order to smooth out little
pieces of metal from the second hole being drilled. The propane injector was
simply created from an 1/8” brass pipe nipple with a #60 hole drilled in the center
of it. The pipe nipple was then placed through the top of the bell reducer and
capped on one end. The hole was oriented directly center pointing towards the
small end of the reducer, and an 1/8” bolt was placed in the previously drilled and
tapped hole to set the pipe nipple in place. A choke was then added on top of
the large end of the reducer by taking an old lid from a jam jar and drilling a hole
through one side of it so that it could sit evenly on top of the reducer and rotate
about the bolt. An 8” long ¾” black pipe nipple was then threaded into the small
end of the reducer after cutting the threads off of one side. For the burner
nozzle, a 3” section of 1” black pipe was used. A hole was drilled through center
of one end of the pipe and the holes were tapped for a ¼” NC set screw. To
create the flared end of the nozzle, an oxy-torch was placed in a vice grip and
used for a heat source. The end of the pipe was then heated up and worked
around a small piece of round stock over and over until a flare with a diameter of
about 1 ½” was created.

14

Figure 10. Flaring the Nozzle over Round Stock
In order for the nozzle to fit over the black pipe nipple, the black pipe nipple had
to be tapered using a bench grinder. The nozzle was placed on the black pipe
nipple and set in place using two hex bolts. These hex bolts were later changed
to set screws because the clearance between the nozzle and burner holder was
not great enough to allow the burner to be installed. The brass pipe nipple was
then connected to a 0-30psi propane regulator by a swivel fitting to a 3/8” hose.
All the threaded connections in the burner were later doped to seal them.

Insulation. The entirety of the forge body was then cleaned with a wire wheel
and spray painted with 2000 degree F rated high-heat black paint. Two layers of
1” thick 2400 degree F ceramic fiber blanket was then installed inside the forge
body covering the entire inside surface. An “x” was then cut into the blanket from
the burner holder hole. The outside diameter of the forge body was then traced
onto a piece of ½” x 1’ x 1’ ceramic fiber board and cutout with a coping saw. A
rectangular section was then cut out of the board. Later, paint had to be wire
wheeled off in four spots so ½” pieces of ½” x ½” x ⅛” angle iron could be welded
to the edge of the forge body in order to hold the fiber board in place. All
surfaces of the fiber blanket and fiber board were then painted with a clay-like
refractory material called ITC-100 and allowed to dry. Later, the forge had to be
heated to its running temperature and then let cool three times in order to set the
refractory coating. Six 2” thick firebricks were then acquired and stacked in front
of the opening.

RESULTS

During the initial testing of the burner, it was found that flames shot out of all
threaded fittings that weren’t sealed, but after the problem was fixed and all
threaded fittings were doped, the burner worked. A nice steady flame could be
produced using the choke in conjunction with the regulator to establish a flame
with a proper air fuel mixture. The flame could then be easily adjusted using both
aforementioned devices to achieve the desired output.
The fully constructed forge was able to reach peak heat after being run for only a
couple of minutes. The flame was easy to establish and control, and even after
being run for a significant length of time, the handle and bottom of the forge did
not get too hot to touch.

The cost for the project was analyzed by breaking the process down into two
distinct sources of cost: parts and labor. The parts were then counted as were
purchased. The labor was counted using realistic assumptions for what it would
actually cost a company. The materials acquisition and construction portion of
the project was priced at $70.00 an hour because that includes the hourly wage
of the employee doing the work as well as the cost to own and run the equipment
and tools required. The research and design portion of the project as well as the
testing phase were priced at $15.00 an hour because they do not require much
machinery besides the product itself and can be done by an employee at regular
wages.
The cost of the project was extremely high when labor is counted because of the
man-hours invested. The actual cost of the parts required to construct the forge
was relatively low, and the actual cost to build it was even lower because some
parts were salvaged from the scrap pile, which meant not having to purchase
some of the materials on the parts list. In the future, if this project were to be
done again, the time needed to research and design it would be cut down to
almost nothing more than familiarization with this report. A lot of time was
wasted in the shop either waiting to use equipment or needing to be taught how
to do certain things, and so time could be shaved off the construction phase by
already knowing how to do all of the steps involved. Time for testing cannot
really be cut, however, since this design is known to work, one could skip the
lengthy testing phase and simply start using it after it is built and checked for
basic proper function.
A small propane forge can be purchased for a few hundred dollars which beats
the project cost by a longshot. The price for building one would be lower if more
material was closely accessible and did not have to be shipped long distances,
but someone without shop equipment would not be able to make it on their own.

RECOMMENDATIONS

For a future forge, a larger body as well as a second and possibly third burner
would expand the capabilities of the forge. With a larger body, if even only by
two inches, bigger pieces of metal could be accommodated in the forge but they
would require that second burner. A third or fourth burner could be used to
increase the reachable temperatures inside the forge. The thickness of the
current body is also unnecessary and adds extra weight that the user has to deal
with. For a body, an old propane tank would be a great option to go with. It
would be lightweight as well as a larger diameter than the forge that was built. If
the same amount of insulation was used, the outside metal would still not get
warm. Welding to the thin gauge steel might be more challenging but overall it
would be a better forge.
As far as burners go, the burner that was used works great. If the forge were
going to be moved to a location with an elevation significantly above sea level,
then a blown burner might be considered to replace the current atmospheric
burner.
Another addition to the forge that would make it better would be an ignition
system. Currently, the gas has to be turned on and lit with a barbecue lighter,
but if there was some kind of small spark igniter inside the forge then it could be
started with a simple button press. The difficulty in that is finding something that
can withstand the heat, which was the reason that option was ruled out in the first
place.
One other firebrick would be a great addition to the forge. It would be a ½” thick
firebrick used for the floor of the forge to set pieces on so that the fiber blanket
does not get damaged. It was a part of the original design but limited availability
left it out of the final assembly.
A final recommendation would be to build a door for the front of the forge that has
a rectangular port for minimum ventilation purposes, but could be opened to set
and retrieve large pieces inside the forge.

HOW PROJECT MEETS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BRAE MAJOR

Major Design Experience
The BRAE senior project must incorporate a major design experience. Design is
the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet specific needs.
The design process typically includes the following fundamental elements. This
project addresses these issues as follows.
Establishment of Objectives and Criteria. Project objectives and criteria are
established to meet the needs and expectations of the client. See Design
Parameters and Constraints below for specific objectives and criteria for the
project.
Synthesis and Analysis. This project incorporates energy output calculations,
thermal resistance calculations, and the consideration of alternative forging
methods.
Construction, Testing, and Analysis. The propane forge was designed,
constructed, and tested.
Incorporation of Applicable Engineering Standards. NFPA Codes which deal
with liquefied petroleum gas.
Capstone Design Experience
The BRAE senior project is an engineering design project based on the
knowledge and skills acquired in earlier coursework (Major, Support and/or GE
courses). This project incorporates knowledge/skills from these key courses.
▪ BRAE 129 Shop Skills and Safety
▪ BRAE 133 Engineering Graphics
▪ BRAE 152 SolidWorks
▪ BRAE 232 Ag Structures Planning
▪ BRAE 421/422 Equipment Engineering
▪ ME 302 Thermodynamics I
▪ ENGL 149 Tech Writing
▪ CHEM 124/125 Chemistry for Engineers
Design Parameters and Constraints

26

This project addresses a significant number of the categories of constraints listed
below.
Physical. The forge dimensions ended being 12” x 14” x 15” and weighed about
50 lbs. The opening is 6” and has a tool rest.
Economic. Propane is cheaper than charcoal to purchase on a per energy
basis.
Environmental. The propane emits less carbon than the dirty-burning charcoal
forge.
Sustainability. Propane is from fossil-fuels and charcoal is from wood so it is
not as sustainable as the old forge.
Manufacturability. The project was able to be constructed from the tools in the
BRAE shops.
Health and Safety. The forge is only be used in outdoors or well ventilated
areas because of the carbon monoxide output. Gloves and eye protection are
also worn when using the forge.
Ethical. Operator safety was not neglected in order to meet other constraints
such as Economics or Sustainability.
Social. The propane forge is noisier than the charcoal forge but produces less
smoke.
Political. The propane forge helps reduce air pollution.
Aesthetic. The finished product is painted with heat resistant spray paint to
protect from corrosion and give a nice appearance.
Other-Productivity. The forge is able to reach 2,300 degrees F.

APPENDIX B
DESIGN CALCULATIONS

28

1. Design Calculations for Heat Energy Output
Formula used:
Burner output (BTU/hr) =
((π*(gas orifice)2)/4)*(orifice discharge coefficient/144)*(21,407*√(propane
pressure))*2,498 BTU/cu ft*60
Gas orifice = #60 drill bit = 0.040 in
Orifice discharge coefficient = 0.75
Propane pressure = 5 psi – 15 psi
Burner output = 47,000 – 81,000 BTU/hr

2. Design Calculations for Heat Loss
R-Values (thermal resistivity)
R = 1/k
R (steel body) = 1 / 40 BTU*in/hr*ft2*°F
= 0.025 hr*ft2*°F/BTU*in
R (Inswool fiber blanket) @ 2000 deg F = 1 / 2.34 BTU*in/hr*ft2*°F
= 0.427 hr*ft2*°F/BTU*in
Composite R value = ( 0.025 * 0.364 in ) + ( 0.427 * 2 in ) = 0.863
hr*ft2*°F/BTU
0.836 hr*ft2*°F/BTU * ( 1 / .5’ * π ) * ( 1 / 2200 °F ) = 0.00024196 hr/BTU
1 / 0.00024196 hr/BTU = 4,134 BTU/hr lost through the walls of the forge

Exhaust losses = about 75-90% of the heat produced
*If only 1” of insulation was used:
Composite R = 0.4361 hr*ft2*°F/BTU

29

0.4361 hr*ft2*°F/BTU * ( 1 / .5’ * π ) * ( 1 / 2200 °F ) = 0.0001262 hr/BTU
1 / 0.0001262 hr/BTU = 7,924 BTU/hr
3. Design Calculations for Heat Transfer to Part
Specific heat of mild steel = 0.122 BTU/lb*°F

Low end (assuming fully open exhaust ports):
(47,000 BTU/hr * .1) – 4,100 BTU/hr = 600 BTU/hr to part
For a 12 oz blade: 0.122 BTU/lb*°F * (.75 lb) / ((600 BTU/hr) *(1hr/60 min))
= 109°F/min

High End (assuming closed exhaust ports):
(81,000 BTU/hr * .25) – 4,100 BTU/hr = 16,150 BTU/hr to part
For a 12 oz blade: 0.122 BTU/lb*°F * (.75 lb) / ((16,150 BTU/hr) *(1hr/60
min))
= 2,940°F/min

4. Design Calculations for Cost to Run Forge
At 5 psi:
47,000 BTU/hr / (21,548 BTU/lb) = 2.18 lb/hr
2.18 lb/hr / (20 lb tank / $20 ) = $2.18/hr
At 15 psi:
81,000 BTU/hr / (21,548 BTU/lb) = 3.76 lb/hr
3.76 lb/hr / (20 lb tank / $20 ) = $3.76/hr

*If only using 1” of insulation:
Extra loss = 7,924 BTU/hr – 4,134 BTU/hr = 3,790 BTU/hr

30

Extra Cost =
3,790 BTU/hr / (21,548 BTU/lb) = 0.18 lb/hr
0.18 lb/hr / (20 lb tank / $20 ) = $0.18/hr
