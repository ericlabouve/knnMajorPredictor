ABSTRACT
A particular frozen food processing facility uses a once-through cooling process
to bring their kettle-cooked product’s temperature down from nearly boiling
temperatures to the eighty degree Fahrenheit range. This process is water
intensive and facility managers are seeking to reduce their potable water
consumption. Sales engineers from Air Treatment Corporation, an HVAC&R
manufacturers’ rep, initiated a number of meetings to propose heat rejection
solutions and illustrate their associated payback potentials.
This report contains methods of analyzing a food production process, the
technical sales process, thermodynamic principles, refrigeration technologies, and
the application of technical knowledge to provide a long-term, system solution.
To justify the purchase of a system solution, a detailed engineering economic
analysis was conducted to account for the time-value of money and equipment
specifications.
The goal of this report is to show the potential for monetary savings by combining
technical, system solutions with sustainability.

INTRODUCTION
Water Supply and Utility Background
Due specifically to periods of extended drought across California, Governor Brown issued a
statewide mandate declaring heightened regulation on potable water-use and associated waste.
(SWRCB 2016). Although the state’s measure requires a 20% reduction in water use by 2020,
local water agencies will tailor the framework of how they will conduct their conservation
efforts. Sonoma County Water Agency relies heavily on precipitation for its freshwater
deliveries which requires adequate storage and timely allocation. The unpredictability of
atmospheric rivers (CW3E) and a recent reduction of snowpack by 25% (Berg 2017) presents
challenges to the water managers to ensure a consistent surface water supply for the future.
Groundwater will also become increasingly difficult to access as time progresses. Local
governments in Sonoma County have already posed the idea of developing fees on unsustainable
pumping behavior and are empowered to do so by the Sustainable Groundwater Management
Act of 2014 (SCSGM 2016). Due to a combination of conservation efforts and the growing
challenges in water management, water sales have had a steep decline. This has forced the City
of Santa Rosa and Sonoma County Water Agency to increase their rates to restore cash flow for
operations and maintenance as seen in Figure 1 below. Supporting documentation provided by
the city of Santa Rosa can be found in Appendix O (SRW 2016).

Figure 1 Behavior of annual water and sewage rates

Due to this, industrial consumers can expect rate increases for both water and sewage, despite the
fact that their consumption could remain stable. This will force companies to reanalyze the way
they use their water and adopt reduced water-consumptive practices. Inefficient use of water,

2
correlated with unsustainable practice, is in opposition to the Reasonable and Beneficial Use
Doctrine which could lead to penalties (Wilson 2011).

Industrial Water Use
In Santa Rosa, industrial demand of potable water amounted to 251 acre-feet or over 81 million
gallons among 69 customers. This would amount to an average of about 1.2 million gallons per
year per industrial user. A particular food processing facility uses high volumes of water for
sanitation, cooking, and cooling applications relative to the industrial average for Santa Rosa.
Figure 2 below shows the portion of water that the facility uses relative to all other commercialtype users which includes manufacturers or processors of materials defined by NAICS code
sectors 31 to 33 in Santa Rosa (UWMP 2015).

Figure 2 Pie Chart of Industrial Water Users
This level of consumption has led the food processing facility and the city to investigate steps in
production that contribute to the highest levels of consumption. In order to do this, the city hired
water-use consultants to audit the process to identify areas needing improvement.

Process Assessment

Figure 3 Facility’s Water Consumption Diagram

After conducting the facility-wide audit, it was determined that the kettle deck was consuming
the largest volumes of water for a single process relative to the other processes throughout the
facility. Table 1 summarizes the results of the audit.

In doing this, various consultants and members of the given food processing facility have come
to an agreement that the current once-through kettle cooling operation is critical to the path of
improved water-use. It should be noted that more recent information after the audit was released
related to water consumption at the kettle deck with values closer to 18 million gallons.
Improvements to this cooling process have been made by members of a manufacturers’
representative known as Air Treatment Corporation. They represent a large number of

4
HVAC&R related manufacturers including: ABB controls and drives, Polaris heat exchangers,
and BAC heat rejection equipment (i.e. cooling towers, thermal energy storage, and evaporative
condensers). Particular to the water used at the kettle deck, a closed-circuit cooling tower has
been proposed to meet the cooling capacity while dramatically reducing the amount of water
consumed. Although there are many features involved in the refrigeration process, this report
focuses on the cooling of the food product from boiling water temperatures to the eighty degree
Fahrenheit range. Improvements are expected to produce large monetary benefits from the
reduced water usage and the anticipated increase production capacity. The objective of this
report is to outline the methods of Air Treatment Corporation’s product solution selection, the
sales process, and the anticipated payback with a capital budgeting analysis.

Project Initiation
Sales Cycle
Once the job was prospected, Air Treatment Corporation began to engage in the technical sales
process. A sales engineering manager from ATC was sent out to meet with clients in order to
further define the problem. After meeting with the plant supervisor, a follow-up meeting was
scheduled to learn more about the various constraints that would influence the type of
refrigeration solution to be selected. Facility managers expressed that a decision would need to
be made before the end of the fiscal year in 2016 and the payback would need to be in the range
of three years. The next step in the technical sales process required the sales engineer to
synthesize a proposed system solution with these key financial parameters in mind.
The next meeting consisted of a detailed economic analysis, including relevant equipment
specifications, in order to illustrate returns on investment. While alternatives were addressed,
there was a clear need to implement a recirculating system for the once-through cooling process.
Upon further probing, there were a multitude of areas needing improvement for other facility
refrigeration process thus expanding the scale of the project. Utilizing the areas of expertise in
the room, appropriate data and information were collected in order to begin measuring the extend
of savings that could be achieved from load shifting for the proceeding cooling process from 80
to 35 degrees Fahrenheit. This increase in project scope allowed solutions to be split into two
phases: kettle cooling upgrades and mechanical cooling upgrades.
While negotiation strategies are important in the sales process, not enough information released
in order to mention for this specific project. However, rebates provided by local utilities were
leveraged as an incentive to pursue this capital investment.
With the right balance of professional consultation and expression from the clients, ATC closed
the deal for cooling improvements at the kettle deck known as the first phase.
The second phase was to replace the air-cooled condensing system, but is outside the scope of
this report. For the first project phase, a specific model of an industrial fluid cooler will be
selected that best accommodates the food processing facility parameters. Figure 4 below
illustrates the basic components of the technical sales cycle.

Project Parameters
There are many benchmarks that can be applied to an “improved” operation. Facility
improvements could result in environmental benefits to the community and further optimize
production capacity, however, these are difficult project with information currently available.
This report is primarily concerned with the savings incurred from reduced water consumption
and improvements to the refrigeration system. A number of variables are involved with the
justification of such a project: governmental regulation, utility incentive programs, facility
constraints, and company priorities. To create a relevant benchmark of success, the company’s
priorities were outlined for the cooling solution to the kettle deck operation. The given food
processing facility has arranged their list of priorities in the following order:
1) Food safety and quality
2) Water consumption
3) Cooling capacity
This list of company priorities will play an integral role in the decision making process for the
best, long-term system solution.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Food processing
Definition
Food processing can be defined as any manipulation of the physical or chemical composition of
raw ingredients in order to produce a food product. These processes include, but are not limited
to the following: sanitizing, pressurizing, mincing, mashing, liquefying, cooking, baking,
cooling, and packaging. Each of these processes has associated consumptions of energy and
water. Learning more about the sequence and dependencies between the events in these food
processes give us better understanding as to where beneficial improvements can be made.
Food Safety
When food production and processing became industrialized, leading to increased capacity, this
provided for tighter tolerances in all aspects of food safety and quality assurance. Due to this,
governmental organizations such as the Food and Drug Administration, have implemented
provisions like Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls in order to prevent food
borne illnesses. Food processing companies are at minimum expected to produce a product that
is deemed “safe” with non-toxic levels pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and other various
contaminants. Ranging from food handling to temperature regulation, there are many
opportunities for commodities to be spoiled and result in detrimental losses.
More specifically, with frozen foods processing, taking cooked product from boiling
temperatures to freezing temperatures crosses a hazardous region for mesophilic microorganisms
to thrive and reproduce. Figure 5 shows the growth behavior mesophilic pathogens in food.
These bacteria are most replicate in food quickest around 100 Farenheight (38 Celsius) which is
dangerous for human consumption because of how close this temperature is to the average
human body temperature (AgriLife Extension 2016).

Figure 5 Spectrum of various bacteria’s optimal temperature range (Todar 2008)

7
Because of this, the FDA has set regulations in the Food Code that require hot foods within the
region of 135F to 70F to be cooled in under two hours (Food Code 2013). This is to avoid
dangerous levels of bacteria growth, limiting exposure to humans. Popular pathogens in food
include, but are not limited to the following: Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli.
Furthermore, refrigerant selection is also important in regards to food safety. Propylene glycol is
an example of a food grade refrigerant with water to reduce the freezing point for low
temperature applications. Food-grade refrigerants are required when refrigerants come into such
close proximity with the product throughout the plumbing of food processing facilities.
Food Quality
Characteristics like taste, appearance, nutritional value, and structure are greatly influenced by a
product’s temperature profile. Based on consumer preferences, the tolerances for these qualities
can be extensive requiring high system precision and redundancy. Specialty food products,
which lack GMO, lose the benefits of reduced risk of disease, improved food structure, and
longer shelf life. Because the given facility produces a non-GMO product, they are forced to
look into their production practices to provide desirable characteristics to stay competitive
(UCSC 2005).
One characteristic particularly important to the given facility is the food structure. When foods
are frozen, the water contained within the product’s plant cell walls expand. This compromises
the structure of food product, especially with relatively high water contents. However, this can
be avoided by rapidly cooling which forms many smaller internal ice crystals, thus minimizing
cell wall rupture (UMich 2014).
In summary, product physical and chemical consistency in food production are extremely
important in high volume, automated operations. Ensuring a strong cold chain with proper
cooling capacities provides greater resistance to inconsistencies and hazards in system outputs.
These considerations play an important role in properly assigning heat rejection solutions to the
kettle deck cooling process.
Case Study: Industrial Tomato Processing Operation - Water Energy Nexus
When looking to create an operational definition for success in this project, it is important to put
inputs and outputs in comparable terms. For example, contributions from research institutions
and the Department of Energy used various water-energy nexus methodologies to analyze a
particular tomato processing facility and recovery payback potentials. With an understanding of
the tomato paste production process in Figure 6 below, tomato water condensate could be
recovered to sanitize, to transport tomatoes in processing flume, or to recover thermal energy. By
analyzing the process in terms of comparable flows of heat and water, the TWC was recycled
and used for steam generation in the “hot break”. The hot break is an essential process in the

8
tomato paste processing industry to provide a desired viscosity. In this case, the circled region
indicates where the water was recommended to be reused.

Figure 6 Typical tomato paste food process v. recommended (Amán 2015)
This type of reuse had a cascading effect and allowed for four different sources of savings down
the process chain. First off, the cost natural gas burned to create the steam was reduced.
Additionally, the volume of water and its associated well pumping cost for steam production
were also negated. Tomato water previously was sent to a cooling tower before being disposed of
as sewage. Moreover, since the TWC would be recycled for its heat, the facility could avoid
energy expenditures related to the cooling tower.
Furthermore, the study emphasized that less volume of water would be drained to wastewater
facilities contributing to even more cost-benefits (Amán, Maulhardt, Wong, Kazama, &
Simmons 2015).
It’s clear that the sustainable strategies implemented produced large annual cost-savings, but
each facility must analyze its own process by food type and facility constraints in order to make
the best improvements. In summary, two universally important resources are of utmost
importance to all production facilities: time and money. However, breaking down the
constituents that contribute to slack time and unnecessary expenditures are key to streamlining
unique processes to their highest potential. Improved operating efficiency and sustainable
improvements are made possible with proper system analysis and adaptations.

Constituents of Financial and Time-Based Constraints
Water-use
Industries can get their water from two categories of sources: public supply and/or groundwater.
Water is used in many tasks of food processing: conveyance, cooking, cooling, sanitation,
brining, and even as an ingredient in the final product. Food and kindred products manufacturing
are among the top three most water consumptive industries in California rate at 1967 gallons per
employee per day. As of year 2000, food processing (i.e. dairy, meat, fruit and vegetable, and
beverage processing) constitutes 24% of all industrial water use as seen in Table 2 (Gleick 2003)
Table 2 Estimated 2000 Water Use in California’s Commercial and Industrial Sectors in
AF/year (provided by Pacific Institute)

10

For cooling processes, regional water availability and resupply rates will greatly influence where
industrial users can expect to get water from. Specific to California, freshwater resources have
become increasingly important and at times limited due to the transforming climate. Therefore,
the largest consumptions of water, whether it is cooling or sanitation, should be evaluated for
improvements.
Due to geographical and political differences between regions, the structure for water and
sewage rates vary greatly. Sewage rates can be based on total volume, demand flow rate, TSS,
BOD content, or any combination of these. Dependent on each food process, steps can be taken
to optimize the cost of sewage based on a given rate structure. For example, if wastewater
treatment plants only charged by TSS and not total volume, theoretically water could be used to
dilute effluent, lowering the concentration seen at the wastewater facility, thus reducing sewage
rates. Although this is an unrealistic scenario, this is the premise behind food processing system
optimization as it relates to water-use.
Electricity
Electrical supply capacity, hours of operation, and building load profile are also common
constraints in the food manufacturing and processing industry. With a general understanding of
power generation, power distribution, and power quality, this allows us to understand why
certain characteristics are considered in system selection.
It is important to keep in mind that electrical utility rates are determined by a provided a rate
structure dependent on the following criteria: user-type, demand type, power quality, and timeof-usage. Typical peak hours of operation are from 12 P.M. to 6 P.M. as seen in Figure 8 below.

Figure 8 Sample rate structure based solely on time-of-day principle (provided by PG&E)

11
Though electricity consumption is a relevant variable, water –use efficiency will likely
contribute to the greatest source of savings further influencing a system solution.
Fixed Assets
Among many resource constraints, existing facility processing equipment and buildings space
availability are variables that system optimizers have the least control over. This is because there
are many contingencies outside of cooling optimization that go into the way a facility best
processes their food. As a response, sales and application engineers must be diligent to recognize
this and propose system solutions that best integrate with existing food processing systems.
Capital goods such as equipment may include, but is not limited to the following: heat
exchangers, cooking kettles, blanchers, storage vessels, filters, and pasteurizers. In the case of
the given food processing facility, jacketed kettles are used to both cook and cool the food
product. The Lee industrial kettles come with a variety of features including: agitators, uniflow
jackets, lid-types, and hydraulics for tilting based on capacity. These special features and
equipment capacities play an important role in the kettle cooling capacity calculation with
appropriately applied assumptions.
The largest and generally the costliest form of capital is the industrial building itself. This is
subject to the least amount of change when seeking to implement heat rejection solutions.
Refrigeration equipment often consumes a large footprint of area and need to be selected with
the necessary constraints in mind for future developments, current processing operations, and
scheduled maintenances.
Additionally, minimum spatial requirements are specifically important to consider as well.
Compromising the proper spatial requirements of certain heat rejection equipment is detrimental
to its performance when the discharge air is recirculated back into the air inlet.
Finally, sound pollution to the surrounding environment could be an issue if facilities are located
in residential areas. Proper sound attenuation equipment is available for equipment with noise
produced by fans and compressors.
Prospective Operation
Future operation and expansion are also extremely important to consider in providing a system
solution. A growing business may be looking into other relevant capital investments that could
couple well with the system solution in mind. In the case of the given food processing facility, a
Blentec food processor has been purchased to improve the mechanical cooling process. This will
be taken into consideration when ATC proposes a system solution for phase 2 of the cooling
process.

Refrigeration in Food Processing
Principles and operation of refrigeration technologies
Refrigeration equipment commonly takes advantage of the chemistry of selected refrigerant
fluids in order to optimize heat transfer with minimized compressor power expenditure.
Generally, most matter experiences three states: as a solid, a liquid, and/or a gas. Depending on
the state variables they are prescribed (temperature, pressure, etc.), they can occupy any of these
forms. Based on changes of these state variables, substances can experience phase changes going
from liquid to gas, solid to gas, etc. Particularly, water has a relatively high latent heat of
vaporization. This means that it will accept much more heat while changing phase to a vapor
compared to many other fluids at atmospheric pressure. This makes water an effective medium
for heat rejection at the right wet-bulb conditions.
Evaporative Cooling Systems
One prime example of an evaporative cooling system is the cooling tower. Cooling towers
uniquely take advantage of water’s chemistry capable of rejecting equivalent amounts of heat
without the use of a compressor. Given certain parameters of relative humidity, dry-bulb, and
wet-bulb temperatures, evaporative cooling may be applied. In order to identify the appropriate
conditions for this kind of cooling, psychrometric charts are a tool used to approximate the
feasibility for a given application.
Where water vapor pressure in the ambient air is greater, water molecules will be less likely to
escape a droplet, thus reducing the extent of evaporation. Conversely, lower vapor pressure will
contribute to more molecules escaping the confines of a droplet. Wet-bulb temperature serves as
an indication for the efficacy of evaporative cooling which is dependent on atmospheric pressure
and relative humidity at a given dry-bulb temperature. Dry-bulb only takes into account the gas
constituents of air when measuring the average kinetic energy of a substance (i.e. temperature).
Understanding the distinction between the dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures is important in
order to understand when evaporative cooling systems can be implemented.
Facilities where the exit water temperature required is above the regional wet-bulb temperature
could consider evaporative cooling as product solution to cooling (BAC 2015). An example of
commonly recognized evaporative cooling equipment is the cooling tower as shown in Figure 9.

13

Figure 9 Typical Closed-circuit cooling tower (BAC Product Handbook Vol. 5)
As previously mentioned, cooling towers can be used in conjunction with water-cooled chillers
or they be directly applied to the heat load. This equipment removes heat from surrounding air
by allowing water and air to passing through channels or fill. Above the fill are water sprayers
reducing droplet size with application across the entirety of the top layer of fill. We can expect
the reduction in droplet size facilitates a more rapid mass and energy transfer between the airwater boundaries due to the increased droplet surface area-volume ratio. Additionally, the
tortuous path the water must take increases the air-water interface time allowing extended
evaporation to occur. The evaporation on the draining water rejects heat into the outside
environment thus cooling the return water. Figure 10 below illustrates the relationship between
the temperature of the water in the circuit and the air passing through the tower.

Figure 10 Air and Water Temperature through Tower Profile (Vengateson 2017)

Industrial fluid coolers, also known as closed-circuit cooling towers, utilize heat-exchanging
coils to keep the process fluid in a separate circuit. The refrigerant fluid is either potable water or
a water-glycol mixture.
The coined term for a cooling tower being the sole heat rejection medium is known as “free
cooling”. This is because no mechanical cooling is used, resulting in little to no operating costs.
Technically, input work is still required to pump water with associated pipe friction losses and
sprayer pressures requirements. Additionally, work-input is required to run the fans for induced
inlet air and heaters for defrost cycles in cold regions. However, these amounts are relatively
small compared to the amount of input energy normally required to achieve the same level of
cooling with a vapor-compression based chiller.
Vapor-Compression Refrigeration Systems

Figure 11 Diagram showing how heat rejection is achieved (provided by Carrier)
Figure 11 illustrates the various components of a vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. This is a
popular cycle found in industrial refrigeration equipment. The compressors require great input
horsepower in order to achieve those high pressures. The compressor provides the pressure
necessary to ensure condensation through the next step for optimal heat rejection into the hot
reservoir. In order to avoid high operating expenses, while cooling large loads, application
engineers may select thermal energy storage technology over on-demand chillers.
On-demand chillers can provide for immediate blast chilling, but often have high associated
energy consumption costs. If operations take place during peak-hours of the electrical grid, this
can result in exponentially higher utility rates. Secondly, if a central system chiller needed
maintenance, there would not be a reserve source of cooling to keep operation going. Finally,
implementing a design with a singular chiller would be difficult in order to meet the varying
demand from a food processing facility and from the changes in atmospheric climate. Strategies
to avoid these problems require application engineers to explore load shifting strategies and
technologies by utilizing thermal energy storage.

15
Case Study: Cheese Production Facility – Load Shifting
A study on a cheese production facility in Hanford, California serves a great example to the
advantages of load shifting with thermal energy storage. Designing a system to build ice
overnight when rates are low and demand is not immediately necessary allows the cooling
requirements to be appropriately satisfied during operating hours. A multitude of thermal energy
storage options were considered, but a dynamic, slurry thermal energy storage system was
chosen with 130% reserve storage capacity in the case of scheduled maintenance. In addition,
this particular solution did not require a defrosting cycle with its ice insulation-effect inhibiting
design. Finally, the dynamic TES system allows for ice storage and production to be separated.
Static systems are designed with the intent that the ice formed around the coils remains until it is
melted externally from warm water downstream of load or internally from the coil. However, the
dynamic system results in the higher cooling capacity for the short durations. There are two
reasons for this: 1) the high surface area of the slurry ice particles and 2) the direct contact of
warm water from the load with the slurry ice (Gladis 1997).
These principles of heat transfer and load shifting strategies are pivotal to providing the best
long-term solution for a given cooling process like those at the given food processing facility. A
deeper look into client expectations, facilities operations, and available technologies will provide
for more beneficial, long-term solutions.

HVAC&R Industry Terminology and Thermodynamic Principles
Cooling capacity and total heat rejection are other constraints to be specified in this project. In
order to properly analyze a cooling method, it is important to understand the difference between
an open system and a closed system in thermodynamics. An open system is where mass and
energy crosses the thermal boundary thus displacing heat into surroundings. However, a closed
system allows heat energy to cross the boundary, but no mass. These fundamental
thermodynamic definitions of systems are the framework behind many refrigeration system
technologies.
Furthermore, cooling capacity is defined by tons of refrigeration or the amount of energy
required to completely freeze a ton of liquid water at 0 degrees Celsius in a period of 24 hours. In
other words, cooling capacity is the amount of transferred heat energy that is capable of being
rejected over a certain period of time. This is the HVAC&R industry’s standard unit for
measuring rate of heat rejection between temperature regions across a certain boundary.
Heat Rejection Performance – Vapor-Compression Systems
Measuring thermal performance is different for each piece of heat rejection technology. For
example, chillers using the vapor-compression cycle measure this efficiency with the COP from
Equation 1.

The vapor-compression process can be seen in Figure 12 with the pressure-enthalpy diagram.
This measure of efficiency accounts for the amount of heat absorbed through the evaporator coil
per unit of energy expended by the compressor. It should be noted that this is a theoretical value
and could largely misrepresent realistic COP values due to irreversibility of the operation in
actual performance. Figures 13 illustrates the difference between ideal and actual operation.

Figure 14 below illustrates the enthalpy values at different points in the refrigeration cycle and
how they are used to calculate total heat rejection and compressor work.

17

Heat Rejection Performance – Evaporative Systems
Cooling towers are a prime example of an evaporative cooling system. They are often used in
conjunction with chillers to absorb the heat from condenser side. This allows for the heat energy
to be transferred into the atmosphere leveraging the latent heat of vaporization of water. The
thermal performance or efficiency of a cooling tower is based on the following equation:
µ=

(t i − t o )
∗ 100, Eqn. 2
(t i − t wb )

Where,
µ = Cooling tower efficiency, %
t i = inlet temperature of water to the tower, ℉ or ℃
t o = outlet temperature of water from the tower, ℉ or ℃
t wb = wet bulb temperature, ℉ or ℃

Simply put, there are two primary things that contribute to improved cooling tower thermal
efficiency: range and approach. Range is the difference between the entrance and exit
temperatures of the recirculating water. Approach is the proximity of the exit water’s
temperature to the regional wet-bulb temperature.
This measures of efficiency neglect to factor the energy and water consumption required to
accomplish this cooling effect. Furthermore, a decision matrix with cost and unique features
should be used to compare the heat rejection options to best meet a given project’s definition of
success.
While the pressure-enthalpy diagram is useful for measuring the heat rejected in chillers, cooling
towers use the psychrometric chart for that information. In order to extract useful information
from the psychrometric chart, we must know three independent variables: barometric pressure,
dry-bulb temperature, and a value that indicates the concentration of vapor in the air (wet-bulb
temperature, humidity ratio, water vapor pressure, dew point, etc.) Table 3 indicates the variables
found on the psychrometric chart and how they are obtained.

18
Table 3 Variables from the Psychrometric Chart (provided by Green Building Advisor)

The psychrometric chart is a tool used to identify the properties of air based on the amount of
water vapor present. With three independent variables and the correct assumptions, this tool
allows both the heat rejection and the volume of water evaporated to be calculated for a given
cooling tower.
The psychrometric chart below illustrates the sensible and latent heat absorbed by the air as it
passes through the tower’s fill to the outlet.

Figure 15 Latent and sensible components of total heat rejection vector
With value for air flow and two known points, the volume of water evaporated from the cooling
tower can be computed based on the change in specific humidity or humidity ratio. The increase
in the humidity ratio represents the water vapor absorbed by the air as it passes through the

19
cooling tower. In most circumstances, it is safe to assume that air exits the cooling tower at
saturated conditions or 100% relative humidity as seen in Figure 15.
Path A-C-B represents conditions where the ambient air is below the temperature of the tower
inlet water. Path D-E-B represents the opposite situation, which greatly affects the amount of
water the equipment can expect to evaporate for the same amount of total heat rejection. Changes
in wet-bulb temperature are the primary drivers for changes in specific enthalpy, which indicate
the cooling effect of the equipment. The similarity between the slope of specific enthalpy and the
slope of wet-bulb lines verify that strong relationship in Figure 16 below.

Figure 16 Wet bulb temperature and specific enthalpy lines respectively
Establishing proper dry-bulb conditions for accurate estimates of cooling tower water usage and
heat rejection are imperative and require justification.

20

PROCEDURES AND METHODS
Initial Considerations
Regional Weather Conditions
For the given food processing facility, the current cooling process of 70 F water is being routed
through to cool the kettles. Additionally, regional wet-bulb temperatures of 67.5 F indicate that
Santa Rosa climate provides favorable conditions for evaporative cooling in this application.
These wet-bulb conditions are guaranteed for 99% of the year while 3 to 4 days of the year are
expected to have wet-bulb temperatures above this temperature (BAC 2015). Weather data
indicates that annual dry-bulb temperature is 71.3 F while higher-end temperatures in summer
months reach approximately 80 F (US Climate Data 2017). This information indicates that
cooling towers should be considered for a refrigeration solution.
Manufacturer
Among the many cooling tower manufacturers, Baltimore Air Coil Company will be the
equipment manufacturer ATC is representing. BAC offers industry leading technology for both
open and closed-circuit cooling towers. In order to determine which should be selected, a
decision matrix was developed in order to quantitatively determine between tower types. Based
on a series of meetings, the information of qualitative features the client was looking for were be
translated into quantitative values. The raw scores were developed according to the client’s
priority levels of the objectives. Table 4 below indicates which of the two would be selected.

A closed-circuit cooling tower has been determined as the better category for a refrigeration
solution at the given food processing facility. While the OCCT provides reduced energy costs, it
compromises food safety by having an open circuit make contact with food processing
equipment inside the facility. Furthermore, the closed-circuit cooling tower has associated water
savings because the water does not need to be treated. With this established, a more detailed
selection process of which model industrial fluid cooler (i.e. CCCT) will be selected.
There are six main models of cooling towers to select from the BAC provider. The towers vary
primarily based on the fan system and the single cell heat rejection capacity ranges. Each product
provides unique features which will be outlined in Figure 17 and 18 below.

It is important that we calculate the minimum tonnage required to see which of the cooling
towers will be needed. To estimate initial feasibility, capacity ranges in the product literature are
based on typical conditions where inlet water is 95 F, outlet water is 85 F, and the wet bulb
temperature is 78 F. The associated tonnages ranges are based on a nominal 3 gpm per ton of
cooling. Selection software will tailor the expected performance of a cooling tower for a design
day in Santa Rosa. A “design day” includes information about the cooling process load and the
prescribed atmospheric conditions.
The unique features of each tower indicate where their application would best be suited. The PFI
towers are designed to operate in climates with high seasonal temperature variation with
anticipated dry operations during the winter. These features disqualify the PFI as a potential
solution because it would be difficult to justify the inflated cost in a temperate region as Santa
Rosa. Additionally, the models equipped with centrifugal fans are used to overcome static head
caused by indoor installation and the ductwork. Because of this feature, models with centrifugal
fans have higher energy consumption making it irrelevant for the outdoor application at the given
food processing facility. Finally, the HXV hybrid tower can be disqualified as a solution because
they are best suited for applications with process fluids at temperatures greater than 180 F. This
leaves two potential system solutions: the FXV and dual air intake FXV as seen in Figure 17
above. In order to determine which of the two is more feasible, we must calculate the required
tons of refrigeration from the current process and develop “design day” parameters for the
selection of new equipment.

The plant manager at the given food processing facility conducted kettle tests where a
temperature probe measured the changes in temperature over the course of approximately two
hours at given kettle inlet water temperatures. This raw data collection would allow us to
complete the first step to provide the best system solution. Table 5 and Figure 19 are the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Compilation of Kettle Testing Data
The kettle cooling test information was collected and organized in a fashion that gave us
information about the behavior of the product temperatures as water flowed through the jackets
over a certain period of time. That period of time represents the amount of time normally
consumed in order to achieve desired cooling of the food product.

Conclusions from the kettle cooling tests indicate three different process-cooling conditions:
average, extreme, and representative conditions. Average conditions were based on averages
taken from over 9 sets of kettle tests involving a variety of kettle capacities (i.e. 500 gal, 400 gal,
300 gal). Extreme conditions were based on the highest initial product temperature, lowest
product final temperature, warmer inlet water, and the minimum cooling time. The large value
heat rejection value from the control-mass thermodynamic problem will explain why the specific
temperature, duration, and flow values were chosen. Finally, the representative condition
includes a kettle that undergoes a testing process involving a common kettle capacity with
expected temperature ranges based on what the head cook has experienced in the past. For these
criteria, Kettle No. 18 from Test 4 was deemed representative as seen in Figure 19, Table 5, and
Figure 20 above. The variation of values in the data set may result from varying flows through
the kettles, size variance in kettles, and varying day-to-day water inlet temperatures. The
following considerations should be included in future kettle cooling tests to ensure that readings
are most representative:
•
•
•
•

Use proper flow measurement and logging technology for cooling water
All solutions should be agitated at the same speed
Constituents and characteristics of food product per kettle test should be documented

Developing the Energy Balance for the Closed-System
The following assumptions were made in order to produce a feasible value of tonnage required:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

The food product is contained primarily within the hemispherical portion of the kettle
Food product is filled to 60% of total kettle capacity
Sensible heat transfer between food product and cooling water
Heat rejected from walls of steel kettle to surrounding atmosphere negligible
Kettle lid was closed, creating a closed system
Heat primarily conducted through steel jacketed portion
Isochoric process
15 gpm of water flow per kettle

Guided by the zeroth law of thermodynamics, heat transfer can be expected from a variance in
temperatures across the boundary. Additionally, the first law of thermodynamics states that
energy is neither created nor destroyed, but transferred or transformed instead. This transfer
occurs to/from the system, through a defined boundary, from/to a surrounding environment. It is
important to note that only changes in energy can be readily observed with this simplicity. Figure
19 below illustrates the schematic used to conduct energy balance computation.

Figure 21 Schematic of control mass for closed-system calculation
For a proper deduction of heat rejected, the fundamental energy balance should be used. The
simplified energy balance equation for a closed system is denoted as follows:
∆𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 = ∆𝑈𝑈 + ∆𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 + ∆𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 , Eqn. 3

Sign convention for heat and work into system are opposites. While heat flowing in the system is
represented as a positive number, work into system is represented by a negative number. The
schematic illustrates heat and work and their associated directions.
Since this is an isochoric process (i.e. constant volume), we assume the fluid does no work to the
system. Another assumption is that the lids on the kettles are kept closed during the
cooking/cooling process. Therefore, this creates a fully "closed" system where no mass crosses
the boundary. The change in total energy of the fluid can be described by:
∆𝐸𝐸𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 = ∆𝑈𝑈 = 𝑄𝑄𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 0 = 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑄𝑄𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 , Eqn. 5

Using the mass of our product, a representative heat capacity, and a best condition for
temperature change, we can solve for the heat rejected out of the kettles. The following results
were obtained by calculating the heat rejected with all three of those conditions. The kettles cook
a large variety of products including, but not limited to: vegetables, black-eyed peas, sauces,

30
beans, and some various chili recipes. Beans provided a representative heat capacity and bean
density was used to estimate the mass of product in the kettles. A representative mass of 2700 lbs
was calculated. Additionally, eight 500-gallon kettles were used to represent a design day heat
load. Since each of our kettles requires 15 gpm of water flow, we can expect a total required
refrigerant flow of 120 gpm. The following tables contains the results of our calculations.

Among these three conditions, the average condition was determined to be the best information
to use for the selection software. With knowledge of the rate of heat rejection, various methods
can be used to determine the temperature of the water leaving the kettle jacket.

Determining Final Water Temperature from Kettle Jacket
There were two methods used in order to determine the final water temperature: using cooling
tower equations and using steam tables with control-volume analysis.

With proper rearrangement, Equation 7 is used to determine the final water temperature.

Since the assumption was made that the only significant heat transferred is to the jacket water,
the water flows in a fixed volume, the following equivalence can be developed:
−𝑄𝑄̇𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = 𝑄𝑄̇𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 , Eqn. 8

Water in this temperature range was considered relatively incompressible so a single value for
density could be used. Using Equation 8 above, the final temperature of the water was calculated
to be 88 F. This final water temperature value makes sense because our food product and water
are approaching thermal equilibrium. We can verify this is a reasonable value by crossreferencing with the T-v diagram and steam tables for water.
Method 2
Using control-volume equation and properties of the initial condition, the final temperature of the
water can be determined. Figure 22 below is a schematic for the given problem:

Due to the behavior of water in the compressible liquid region, the enthalpy for a liquid can be
well represented by the enthalpy for a saturated liquid at a given temperature. Figure 23 indicates
the unique behavior of compressible liquids that justify the use of the saturated liquid values for
the steam tables.

Since we know two independent properties, inlet temperature and inlet state, we can use the
steam tables. Since the saturated liquid can represent the enthalpy values for compressible
liquids, a value can be interpolated from the table for the initial enthalpy. Equation 10 above can
then be used to determine the exit enthalpy. Finally, another interpolation including both
temperature and enthalpies for the inlet and outlet reveals an exit water temperature of 87.7 F.
Table 9 Steam tables for saturated water (provided by Wiley 2011)

The two methods of calculating exit temperatures verify that 88 F is a reasonable value to use for
outlet temperature of exit water. The appropriate assumptions bulleted above provide for a

34
simple analysis in order to streamline proposal development. This allows sales engineers to
quickly determine feasibility of a project and provide system solutions in a shorter time-period
keeping businesses profitable. Design engineers are anticipated to apply a much more thorough
analysis when the job contract is won. With the appropriate range of inlet and outlet
temperatures, wet-bulb temperature, and required refrigeration tons, design day conditions can be
developed and then the selection software can be used.

Establishing Design Day Conditions and Troubleshooting Inputs
Codes, Standards, and Ratings Systems
Upon initial selection, design variables were input as follows: 120 gpm flow, 88 F degree tower
inlet water, 70 F tower outlet temperature, and a 67.5 F wet-bulb temperature. Pure water is used
as our refrigerant because of our temperature range of application. However, warnings showed
up with the list of equipment selections because software inputs/design day conditions did not
meet Cooling Technology Institute’s standards.
Codes, standards, and rating systems decided by ASHRAE and the Cooling Technology Institute
have provided minimum performance requirements for heat rejection equipment. Based on test
procedures CTI ATC-105S and CTI STD-201 RS, this will provide a performance rating for
closed-circuit cooling towers. For propeller or axial fan closed-circuit cooling towers, the
minimum performance requirement is ≥16.1 gpm/HP at conditions of 102 F/ 90 F/ 75 F
(ASHRAE Standard 90.1). These temperatures represent the inlet water temperature, outlet water
temperature, and regional entrance wet-bulb temperature respectively.
Since BAC selection software follows those standards and warnings were indicated, specifically
the minimum approach parameter, the original software selection criteria needed to be adjusted.
This re-selection is required because the leaving fluid temperature must be 5 F above regional
wet bulb temperature according to the CTI STD-201 limits of thermal certification as seen in
Table 10.
Table 10 CTI STD-201 thermal certification limits for Cooling Towers/Closed-Circuit Coolers

Consequentially, in order to achieve the same total heat rejection, the range must be kept the
same but at a pair of higher inlet and outlet water temperatures. A second, modified selection
was made with the following criteria: FXV model, 120gpm, 95F/75F/67.5F, pure water, and with
a price ranked listing of the results. Previous methods for calculating exit water temperature
verify that water can expect to leave at 93 F for the second selection, but an intentional 95 F was

35
applied to provide an additional safety factor for thermal performance. Table 11 illustrates the
modifications to design day conditions.

Additional Selection Requirements
Once the design day criteria had been input, there were additional selection requirements a
selector could have used. This included a maximum fluid pressure drop, number of tower units,
model accessories, and limits on sound pollution, total horsepower, and dimensions. After the
construction site had been surveyed for its available space, there were no other requirements
necessary to further refine selection.

BAC Software Selection
Although modified selection reflects a lower tower efficiency, it provides system redundancy for
non-ideal weather conditions and complies with CTI standards. The software produced a list of
models with the top two options being the FXV-0806B-28D-L and the FXV-806B-32D-K. Both
options were absent of warnings and met thermal performance standards. The options were low
first cost selection (LFC) and recommended selection (Rec) based on payback impact
respectively.

Based on the decision matrix, the FXV-806B-32D-K is the best, long-term system solution.
Although the first model provides a reserve capacity, it does not compare to the level of impact

39
the energy savings of the second model. This was the model recommended for best payback in
terms of annual energy savings. Specifics on various savings will be described in the engineering
economics portion of this report.

Engineering Economics of Product Selection
Capital Budgeting Metrics
For this report, the five payback metrics used are: return-on-investment, the payback period, net
present value, internal rate of return, and modified internal rate of return. Each method of budget
analysis gives decision makers unique insight into the feasibility of the project.
Return on Investment
This value can be given as a percentage or dollar amount comparing the cost of investment to the
expected returns over a certain period. This term is very familiar to facility managers when it
comes to making decisions for capital investments. Although this does not include the time value
of money, this should be included in sales presentations to indicate feasibility and facilitate a
simple understanding among decision makers. For the pro forma spreadsheet, the ROI was
computed over the first three years and did include discounted cash flows.

This method provides a rough estimation as to how quickly a project can be paid off. This is also
useful for determining the feasibility of the project during the sales presentation. This will allow
decision makers to understand how the project needs to be financed and how it fits within the
vision of the company’s priorities. Normally in sales presentations, this method does not account
for the time-value of money. However, cash flows on the pro forma statements have all future
cash flows discounted taking the time-value of money into account.

This indicates how the initial cash outflow (investment) can be compared to discounted future
cash inflows and outflows. A positive NPV value tells us that our future cash flows justify the
initial investment taking the time-value of money into consideration. Determining a
representative discount rate is important and will be further explored.

Internal Rate of Return

This value indicates the discount rate at which future cash flow benefits from a project would
have a net present value of zero. The higher the IRR, the more valuable a capital investment
appears. This method allows for easier interpretation, regardless of financial scale, with percent
values. Although the time-value of money is considered, the IRR calculation assumes that
positive cash flows from the project can be reinvested at a return rate identical to that of the
initial project. To accommodate for this, the MIRR constructs a more conservative reinvestment
rate and includes the finance rate.

Modified Internal Rate of Return

This method offers a more realistic value for rate of return. This is because the water savings
could not be directly reinvested in another identical cooling tower because our operation only
requires one solution of that capacity. Thus, the reinvestment rate of return for this project is
based on the cost of capital. Since this is a private company, information normally used to
calculate the cost of capital is not available. Therefore, the cost of capital for publicly traded food
processors was used for the reinvestment rate. From a sample of 87 different food processors, a
cost of capital was determined to be 5.76% (NYU 2017). Additionally, any negative cash flows
would be discounted by a finance rate of 6%. This represents a typical interest rate at which
banks will loan to industrial customers on construction jobs. The resulting percentage values are
always lower than the IRR.

Minimum Acceptable Rate of Return

41
This is a value that is used by facility managers to decide whether a project is attractive or not.
An acceptable project is deemed when the IRR or MIRR exceeds the hurdle rate (MARR).
Typically, the hurdle rate developed by financial mangers is dependent on the company’s cost of
capital and risk tolerance.
Pro Forma Income Statement
This type of financial document is a tool used by budget analysts to understand the resulting cash
flows from anticipated changes in operation ranging from acquisitions to large capital
investments. This document will allow sales engineers and decision makers to compute payback
metrics to justify or nullify the project. The full pro forma spreadsheet for the 8-year budget
analysis can be found in Appendix M. The following subtopics are items affecting or
representing various cash flows.
Initial Investment Costs
Determining relevant cash flows includes any positive or negative change in cash as a result of
the new investment. The most obvious cash flow would be the net capital investment the
company must make for the cooling tower including the following components: installation,
freight cost, sales tax, and the equipment itself. This fixed cost is primarily justified by the
decrease in processed water contributing to a positive, gradient cash flow series.
Water Rates
The pro forma financial statements are in terms of discrete years (2017, 2018, etc.) despite the
fact that water rates are increased on a semi-annual basis in the months of January and June.
Based on averages of historical water rate increases, an annual increase of 5% was applied to
projected water rates. Figure 26 below and includes historical water rates with projections of
their future values of water rate. Appendix O verifies the historical water rates.

The historical data, the Sonoma County Water Agency website, and public media outlets suggest
that this rate increase is a feasible value to apply. Representing the changes in the water rates was
an important step in the budget analysis because neglecting those changes would have led to a
discrepancy of approximately $85,000 dollars less in the net present value for the 8-year budget
analysis.
Sewage Rate
In addition to the water that delivered, the company must pay for the water it sends back to the
wastewater treatment plant. The sewage rate for this particular application is based solely on the
volume of water sent back, not necessarily the quality of the water (i.e. B.O.D., TSS). However,
the gradual sewage rate increases were computed similarly to the methodology applied to water
rates previously discussed. Figure 27 below. Appendix O verify the historical sewage rates.

This rate increase is accounted for in the pro forma financial statements in terms of discrete years
with an annual 3% rate increases. Neglecting the changes in sewage rates would have led to a
discrepancy of approximately $114,000 dollars less in the net present value for the 8-year budget
analysis.
Cooling Tower Energy Consumption
The next relevant cash flow would be the energy consumption from running the new piece of
heat rejection equipment. This energy consumption is due to the running fan, the sump pump,
and the circulation pump that goes into the facility. PG&E electricity provider applies
complicated algorithms and rate structures in order to encourage sustainable energy
consumption. Among the many things that influence the electricity rate, power-quality and the

43
demand charge associated with current rate plans will not be considered in the scope of this
study. However, factors like the projected rate increases over the 8-year period, time-of-day rate
structure, and customer type will be considered. The most recent electricity rates publicly
available, for industrial customers (E-20) requiring primary power distribution (i.e. supplied
voltage between 2,000 and 50,000 volts), are in Figure 28 outlining the $ per kWh and

Figure 28 Cooling tower energy load profile
The rates in the bar chart above are associated with 2016 values, but will be applied over the
entirety of the year to simplify analysis and eventually provide a more conservative NPV per
year. The distribution of hours of cooling-tower operation was based on the facility’s standard
operating procedures of cooking and cooling five batches of product within the period of 3:30
AM and 9:30 PM. Each batch of food product is cooled within two hours to meet FDA
standards for food safety, to retain food quality, and maintain current food-processing capacity.
Finally, over the 8-year budget analysis, the electricity rates are anticipated to increase each year
by 3%.
The power requirements for the fan and the sump pump were based strictly off the nominal
horsepower ratings listed on the tower datasheet generated by BAC software. Although a
variable frequency drive will be used to adjust the fan speed, thus lowering power consumption,
full-speed operation was considered exclusively for the energy consumption analysis. In reality,
tower fans can be expected to be operating at speeds as low as 50% of maximum.
The circulating pump power consumption was based on interpretations from the pump curve and
worst case pumping scenario for the system curve. With a designated operating point, one could
determine a representative power consumption for the energy analysis. Two scenarios were
considered for operating points: normal and worst-case operation. Normal operation is based on
operation of 8 kettles of 500-gallon capacity operating simultaneously on the main kettle deck.
However, the worst-case scenario was based on the to the simultaneous cooling of 8, 500-gallon
kettles hydraulically furthest from the pumping station. Based on interpretation of the piping

44
layout diagram provided, head and flow requirements were developed to represent the most
power intensive pumping scenario. The following head and flow requirements were largely
based on kettle design, friction loss estimates, static head, NPSH, and changes in elevation. Pipe
friction losses were based on the Hazen Williams equation to provide rough estimates on
pumping costs. Friction loss calculations will need to be reviewed by the refrigeration design
engineer using the Darcy–Weisbach equation to account for turbulent flow and the temperature
gradients throughout the pumping system. Furthermore, friction losses across various valves and
the glycol heat exchanger were included as rough estimates, but also require further
investigation. Finally, a deeper understanding of kettle deck operation will provide an optimized
pump selection based on a representative system curve. By providing a slightly oversized pump
station and variable frequency drive, operators can adjust pump speed according to what
minimizes energy cost while maintaining production capacity. Once the head requirements for
both scenarios were considered, the following equations could be applied to estimate the required
motor horsepower for the pump station.

With normal operation and worst case operation requiring 5.7HP and 8.8HP respectively, a
nominal 10HP motor would be selected for the capital budget analysis. In reality, a variable
frequency drive will allow operators to adjust motor speed allowing for adjustable flow and
head. Therefore, expenses on the pro forma financial statements will be inflated compared to
what the food processing facility will actually incur.
Cooling Tower Water Usage
Another annual cost associated with our capital investment would be the water losses required to
cool the refrigerant returning back to the heat load in our closed-loop. Calculating the total water
usage is important for the pro forma financial statements to investigate payback on project. Total
water use by cooling towers can be described by Equation 19 below.
𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈 = 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 + 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 + 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷, Eqn. 19

The first category of water loss would be due to evaporation. Simply put, the spray water in the
tower making contact with the refrigerant coils, which are plumbed into the kettle jackets, allows
the heat to be rejected into the atmosphere via evaporation. This is represented by the latent
component of heat transfer discussed in the literature review.

45

The next source of water loss is called drift loss. This loss is usually composed of only .1% to
.3% of refrigeration circulation rate (e.g. at .1% and 100gpm refrigerant flow, 0.1gpm of drift
loss). These consist of liquid droplets that get forced out of the outlet due to high air flow.
Another loss is the required bleed-off of the water in the sump tank of the cooling tower. The
selected cooling tower has been designed for 3 cycles of concentration. Due to all of these
various losses, the remaining water eventually increases in concentration of bicarbonates and
other constituents that could potentially compromise cooling tower operation. To prevent this,
water is systematically bled-off in order to prevent costly maintenance caused by the formation
of deposit on the coil surface.
For this report, two approaches were used to compute water usage: 1) interpretation from the
psychometric chart with rule-of-thumb equations 2) utilizing an online cooling tower water-loss
calculator.
Method 1
For the first method, psychrometric chart software by Greenheck was used to provide accurate
values for properties at the inlet and exit of the cooling tower. The following assumptions were
used for the computations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Mass and energy transfer scenario
Total energy rejected by tower absorbed by air
Conservation of mass principle through tower system
Exit air at saturated conditions (i.e. 100% relative humidity)
Atmosphere at a pressure of 1atm
Fan running at half-speed
Affinity law applies
Average specific volume acceptable for water loss estimation
80 F dry bulb inlet temperature representative for a “design day”

These assumptions allow us to use the psychrometric chart to indicate the location for the two
points, compare the change in enthalpy, and dictate the change in humidity ratio. The change in
humidity ratio indicates the amount of water vapor added into the air as it passes through the
cooling tower as seen in Figure 29.

46

After adjustments to exit dry-bulb temperatures were made to correspond to a 1,200,000 BTUH
rate of heat rejectetion and tower specifications, Equation 19 indicated the evaporative loss to be
1.95 gpm.

For drift loss, the rule-of-thumb of .3% of circulating tower flow was used which amounted to
0.36 gpm. Blowdown used an equation based off the percentages of evaporative and drift loss
relative to circulating flow. Equation 20 below, with three cycles of concentration, indicates that
0.62 gpm were lost due to blowdown.

This amounted to a total water usage of 2.93 gpm for Method 1.

47
Method 2
The second method required input information about tower flow, range, ambient wet-bulb
temperature, cycles of concentration, and drift rate. Figures 30 and 31 illustrate the input
variables and the output for water usage respectively.

Figure 30 Water Usage Calculator Inputs (provided by SPX Cooling)

Figure 31 Water Usage Calculator Outputs (provided by SPX Cooling)

Method 2 amounted to a total of 3.35 gpm of industrial fluid cooler water usage. The following
graph was generated by the calculator to indicate water usage based on varying wet bulb
temperature and cooling tower range.

48

Figure 32 Water Usage Graph (provided by SPX Cooling)

Both Method 1 and 2 provided reasonable values of 2.93 gpm and 3.35 gpm respectively. It
should be taken into consideration that changing ambient dry bulb inlet temperature, tower
aging, and fan speed will produce varying water loss values. However, the inlet dry bulb
temperature, fan speed, and wet bulb temperatures selections were intentional to represent a
"design day". With these considerations, a 3 gpm of water use will be used for the pro forma
financial statements to illustrate realistic payback period and return on investment. The
distribution of water use from Method 1 was used and the blowdown value was increased by
0.07 gpm. Table 14 indicates volume of water consumed by each category of use and their
relative percentages of total water use. It is important to separate these types of water use
because blowdown must be accounted for in the sewage costs as well. Table 14 below was
developed in accordance with 3110 operational hours per year.

Miscellaneous cash flows
This equipment also has an associated annual cost for maintenance and inspection. The cost
associated for the technician services is two negative cash flows of $1500 dollars per year.
When looking to determine opportunity cost of the cooling tower investment, it is difficult to
develop a substantial cost compared to the benefits this investment provides. The unit will takeup approximately 143 square-feet and is placed behind the building in a remote location. Due to
the immense returns on investment, opportunity cost related to space can be neglected. The only
opportunity cost associated with this investment is not using the cash in another type of
investment (stock market, bond, annuity, etc.). Since this is covered by the MIRR, the pro forma
statements will not double count opportunity cost in the pro forma financial statement.
On a final note, a boost in productivity may occur due to this improvement in the cooling
process. However, the positive cash flows associated with the increased operational capacity is
important, but outside the scope of this budget analysis.
Depreciation
Depreciation of the cooling tower product was received from the IRS website with tables of asset
class codes and their associated MACRS. The cooling tower was found to have a 7-year recovery
period (OK State 2007). It should also be noted that the salvage value of the cooling tower is
zero considering how specialized the tower is to this particular facility. This would make the
cooling tower a particularly difficult product to resell.
Discount Rate
In determining the discount rate, the factors that influence its selected value are the internal
required rate of return and internal financial advisory.
The required rate of return is influenced primarily by the current risk-free rate of return and
inflation. The risk-free rates are commonly associated with the returns offered on treasury bonds.
Treasury bills at the end of year 2016 indicate an approximate rate of return of .5% for the
maturity of a year-length treasury bond. An approximate inflation rate of 2% was determined
based on typical values observed in the 5 years prior to 2016. The sum of these two would
produce an approximate required rate of return of 2.5%.
The liquidity of assets and the health of the food processing industry influence the risk tolerance
of the internal financial advisory for the given food processing facility. Since much of this

50
facility’s fixed assets contribute to its equity, the company’s liquidity ratio is anticipated to be
low. Additionally, the company’s current assets consist mostly of raw food as inventory, which
is a nondurable good, thus further contributing to a lower liquidity ratio. This ratio indicates how
easily the company could transform capital into liquid funds in the case of an emergency to pay
off debts. These financial and market behavior allow managers tailor the minimum acceptable
rate of return to their respective industry. Accounting for project risk and the liquidity of the
facility, an additional 3.5% should contribute to the minimum attractive rate of return.
Since the MARR was estimated to be 6%, this will also be used as the discount rate. Managers
must adjust the pro forma financial spreadsheet to use a discount rate that reflects the given
facility’s precise minimum attractive rate of return.

Table 16 above shows that this project is highly profitable. By EOY 3, the company can expect
to make their money back with a recovery of $212,672. The net present value indicates that this
project is worth over 1.2 million dollars in year 2016. Furthermore, the IRR and MIRR are likely
to exceed the company’s hurdle rate which further encourages initiating the project ATC has to
offer.

51

Sensitivity Analysis
Before engaging in lofty financial investments, a sensitivity analysis should be used to test the
integrity of the project potential changes in variables contributing to significant cash flows. This
analysis was conducted for each individual scenario that could jeopardize the profitability of this
capital investment:
1.
2.
3.
4.

A reduction in the cost of water by 25%,50%,75%, and 100% for all 8 years
A reduction in the cost of sewage by 25%,50%,75%, and 100% for all 8 years
An electric energy rate increase of two to three times the normal rate for all 8 years
A complete failure of the original cooling tower followed by a complete reinvestment of
the original net capital investment amount: $664,600

Scenario 1: Reduction of the Cost of Water
The measure of the success of the project can be interpreted from its resilience to the reduction
of the water rate in the sensitivity analysis. The excel document tables indicate that if the water
rate was reduced to zero, for all 8 years and ceteris paribus, the sewage rate savings would still
provide a NPV of $664,601 and an IRR of 27%. With further testing, profitability was most
sensitive to changes in the sewage rate.
Scenario 2: Reduction of the Cost of Sewage
Keeping all other factors constant, if there was no sewage rate applied to the facilities
wastewater, for eight consecutive years, this would make the project unprofitable with a NPV of
-$7,626 and an IRR of 5.7%. This negative net present value makes sense for an investment
project considering the discount rate is 6%. Essentially, the earnings are being discounted at a
higher rate than the potential for returns. However, this scenario is highly unlikely considering
the sewage rates are trending to rise 3% annually and the facility will continue to discharge water
to treatment facilities.
Scenario 3: Energy Rate Price Hikes
The capital investment was also resilient to increases in energy costs two to three times the
normal rate described by the E-20 industrial consumer rates from PG&E. Despite the tripled
energy costs, for all 8 years, the net present value was largely unaffected with a NPV as high as
$1,170,053.
Scenario 4: Complete Failure of Industrial Fluid Cooler
Also, it was determined that the cooling tower would have to break down 3 consecutive years for
EOY 1, EOY 2, and EOY 3 to produce the first negative present value. Even if the machinery
were to break down twice, for EOY 1 and EOY 2, the project would still have a NPV of
$316,187. This was tested by adding a negative -$664,600 cash flow into the maintenance
category ceteris paribus. This demonstrates the large future cash flows in savings that come from
the water and sewage savings.

52
Final Engineering Economics Remarks
Both the sensitivity analysis and the financial metrics indicate that the industrial fluid cooler
capital investment would be a highly profitable investment at the given food processing facility.

53

RECOMMENDATIONS
The kettle cooling and sustainability project can expect three outcomes: water and sewage
savings equivalent to an average of $397,342 annually, a 97% decrease in water usage, and an
improved refrigeration process contributing to improved food safety. Additionally, the local
water authorities of Santa Rosa have provided rebates amounting to $200,000 dollars to assist
with the initial investment.
After the kettle cooling improvements, the given food processing facility should invest in the
improvement of the second phase of cooling. The system solution has a glycol heat exchanger
plumbed into it to streamline this improvement. The upgrade would allow the facility to:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)

Eliminate the bucket cooling process by using the kettles as heat exchangers
Lower the end cooling temperature in phase two
Improve the flexibility of both phase 1 and 2 cooling processes
Provide the capability to further reduce phase 1 cooling time
Ensure resilience of cooling tower performance on days with high wet-bulb temperatures.
Meet the increase in capacity of incoming food processing equipment

Improved monitoring of flow rates and temperature profiles of the kettles are also important for
future facility improvements. Additionally, an outline of the food processing facility’s daily
kettle deck operation should be documented so that the pumping station and distribution system
can be further optimized. Furthermore, an internal case study should be conducted by the given
food processing facility to measure how much more product is being produced as a result of the
system solution.
Currently, the facility kettle decks produce an average of 4663 lbs per operational hour with
3110 operating hours per year (See Appendix B). Since kettle deck is responsible for 77% of the
total food production, improvements to the kettle deck are likely to result in greater annual
production output. Assuming there are no upstream bottlenecks and the demand for the product
was there, this would translate into increased annual sales. This extrinsic benefit of increased
revenue could be applied to the pro forma financial statements further justifying the project. The
conclusions of such a study would further incentivize future project improvements to increase in
production capacity at the kettle deck of similar food processing facilities. Systems solutions,
such as Kettle Cooling and Sustainability Project, are relevant to many industrial and commercial
facilities by coupling profitability with sustainability.
