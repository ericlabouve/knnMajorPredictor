Executive Summary
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has invested considerable effort to develop new
standard for nuclear grade HEPA filters that can withstand high temperatures along with
methods to optimally test not only the experimental filter media, but also new frame seals and
media binders. Therefore, LLNL in collaboration with Cal Poly has designed and built a Mini
High Temperature Testing Unit (MHTTU) to recreate conditions observed during a fire and to
test different materials in an effective, inexpensive, regulated and reliable method. The existing
prototype was unable to achieve the ideal testing conditions of 1000°F air at the low flow rates
of 1.25-12 ACFM; therefore, this project looks to optimize previous efforts on building a portable
and reliable MHTTU to collect more information and perform different tests in various materials
utilized in the construction of ceramic HEPA filters.
Based on previous teams’ inputs, our team performed a heat transfer analysis to determine
critical heat loss points and to optimize the design of the MHTTU. After several idea generation
sessions, it was decided to modified the geometry of the testing chamber and the insulation of
the system. The MHTTU also lacks a robust control system and a user interface; therefore, a
more reliable interface and more versatility during the tests were implemented in the system.
With the current design, we were able to improve the maximum temperature of the system to
837°F; however, we were not able to fulfill heat up time of 15 minutes. After carefully recording
the temperature of the surrounding material during testing, we believe that the immersion heater
is not powerful enough to have an effective heat transfer to air. After testing was completed, it
was confirmed that the heater coils cannot reach 1000°F in less than 15 minutes of heat up.
Therefore, a more powerful heater is needed to achieve testing parameters.

[4]

1. Introduction
Over the years, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) has been developing a new
standard for nuclear grade HEPA filters that can withstand high temperatures along with
methods to optimally test not only the experimental filter media, but also new frame seals and
media binders. In conjunction with California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal
Poly), LLNL has developed a High Temperature Testing Unit (HTTU) capable of testing full
sized filters. LLNL wanted a smaller, mobile system so that students and researchers at Cal
Poly can perform tests similar to those that the full-sized system is capable of. Thus, a Mini High
Temperature Testing Unit (MHTTU) was desired to test smaller sample sizes. The MHTTU was
specified to achieve specific parameters such as high air temperatures and low range of flow
rates range to simulate fire conditions, and collect to help analyze the behavior of different
materials.
Team Daedalus, consisting of Kevin Liu (CPE), Nathan Bernards (ME), Sam Macy (MATE), and
Pablo Castillo (ME), was the next effort to recondition and optimize the MHTTU. Previous
teams, Teams Phoenix and MicroFire, built a fully functional MHTTU that is portable and
complies with the power requirements; however, they came short in achieving the ideal
temperature of 1000°F in the testing area. The MHTTU also lacked a robust control system and
a user interface.
As such, Daedalus was tasked with modifying the system to primarily achieve the desired
specifications outlined in the next section. However, though the build process, it was discovered
that prior teams did not get campus electrician approval for the power system they had
developed and came short on the safety of the power box. This large, unexpected task lead to
major delays in all phases of the development of this iteration of the mHTTU which ultimately
lead to us not achieving the desired specifications.

Specifications and Developments
Team Daedalus’ goal in this project is to deliver a functional miniaturized High Temperature
Testing Unit that meets or exceeds the requirements laid out by LLNL. To help achieve these
specifications, Team Daedalus completed a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) exercise,
making use of the House of Quality technique. This tool helps to take the needs of a customer
and convert them into engineering specifications. In the case of the MHTTU project, many
precise specifications were already provided by LLNL, and thus some of the inputs to Team
Daedalus’ House of Quality did not exactly fit the usual mold of QFD. That said, there were
several customer needs that the team could identify that were not explicitly mentioned in the
customer requirements provided.
Customer Requirements

•

Laminar flow

One such need is proper documentation of the computer code used to operate the control
system. An ongoing issue identified with the previous system is the lack of proper commenting
procedure, along with other kinds of documentation problems. If Team Daedalus developed an
operating manual for the device along with clear comments in the code, it would make operating
the device simpler for users. Clear instructions regarding operation could translate to an
increase in the number of people who can operate it, and proper commenting would allow future
expansion of the control system by other programmers. Another need that was determined was
the capability for the MHTTU to change the parameters of the testing routine dynamically. This
would allow users to change temperature and flow rates during testing without having to restart
the entire process.
The QFD process also gave Team Daedalus a better look at the interrelations between many of
the specifications of the project. For example, changes in flow rate directly affect heat transfer
and thus the temperature of the testing chamber. Each of these will also have an impact on the
amount of power the heater requires, the test chamber temperature rise time, and the back
pressure. Along with the previous parameters, total unit size and user friendly controls will
directly affect cost. Explicit details about the exact nature of these relationships can be found in
the printed spreadsheet of the House of Quality in Appendix A. These specifications are also
listed below in table 1.

Flowrate: This specification refers to the amount of air circulating the system at any given
moment in time. Since it is a closed system, conservation of mass can be applied and used
to calculate the flowrate of the system, even when the system changes in geometry in each
section. A more accurate method to calculate flowrate is to include two pressure transducers
to measure the pressure difference between two sections of the system and calculate the
flowrate. Also, the risk indicated in this parameters refers to the difficulty to achieve the
specified range of 0.5 to 12 actual cubic feet per minute, and it is at low because the input
pressure will be controlled by a control valve, and the pitot-tubes are available to use.
Min Test Chamber Temperature: This parameter sets the minimum temperature desired in
the test chamber to 1100 °F. This temperature will be recorded by means of two different
thermocouples one located in the chamber inlet section and other located in the test
chamber section. These thermocouples will be connected to the control system, Arduino, to
be logged in spreadsheets for further analysis. The risk is set to medium because there are
several heat loss points and previous efforts have been short to reach desired temperature.
Temperature Rise Time: This specification refers to the desired time to reach minimum
temperature. This parameter will be recorded along with the minimum temperature and
simply with a stopwatch. This specification is at high risk because previous tests indicate
that the maximum temperature reached over the span of thirty minutes was 750 °F.
Power Supply Voltage: This is the maximum voltage that can be supply to the system. Due
to safety purposes, this parameter will be measure by simply connected to power outlets
rated at 240V. This is at low risk because Cal Poly has several building that run in 240V,
and it has been arrange to conduct testing in such buildings.

Back Pressure: Back pressure refers to the maximum pressure the system will experience.
This variable is related to airflow and volume of the system. Since airflow is very low and
volume big, the system will not see a high pressure. Because of these reasons, this
specification is at low risk. Also, this variable will be measure with the pressure transducers
used to calculate airflow rate.
Size: Size refers to the overall dimension of the system. Since the focus of the team is to
improve heat losses and test chamber geometry, the overall dimension of the system will not
change and will still comply this requirement; therefore, the risk is at low.
Usability: This parameter is hard to specify since it comprehends several factors; however,
when defining this specification, it was done thinking in the user been able to perform
continuous and accurate tests. The goal is to build an accurate and precise system that
ensure repeatability in testing. This specification will be measure by the spread of the test
results and the quality of such results. The chosen materials are design to withstand such
temperature, pressures, and flowrate; therefore, the risk is at low.
Test Routine Features: This specification deals with the ability to specify different
parameters to be measure in each test. This will be controlled by the implementation of a
robust program that will handle temperature, pressure, and airflow rate, as well as the ability
to change parameters once the test has started. It has a low risk due to readily available
programs that can be implemented to the system.
Safety: Since the Mini HTTU will be running with a high voltage system, it is crucial to have
a safe system that satisfy industry and Cal Poly regulations; therefore, the electric system of
the unit will be design and specified by the team, but it will be assemble by a contractor
working in conjunction with Cal Poly. This is a low risk parameter because of the guarantee
ensured by the contractor.
Cost: the goal of the team is to rebuild and optimize the system with a maximum budget of
$3000. This includes new insulation, new test chambers, heat analysis, flow analysis, and
heaters. Since prices of these features are unknown, the risk is set to medium.
Interface: The interface of the system will be the medium that communicates between the
hardware collecting all the different parameters and the program displaying all previous
parameters. It has been specified that a GUI is desired because it represents a more
common interface that other options available in the market. The risk is set to medium
because it will require fine tuning and debugging to have a reliable and safe program.

2. Background
The results of the background research performed by Team Daedalus largely mirrored that of
Team Phoenix, who designed the heating, power and flow control aspects of the current version
of the MHTTU [1]. This similarity is because no product exists on the marketplace that meets all
of the requirements of LLNL. Additionally, the fact that high temperature testing units for HEPA
filters are not common meant that online and journal searches for information regarding these
types of appliances led Team Daedalus to find many of the same articles as Team Phoenix.
The problem that needs to be solved has already been well defined by previous teams and by
LLNL, and while designs with similar functions were found, none of them operated at the
requirements laid out by LLNL. In addition to examining similar testing machines, Team
Daedalus also researched methods for testing HEPA filters in various environments.

2.1. History of HEPA Filters
High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters were developed as a part of the Manhattan project,
to protect facilities and people from the effects of radioactive particles. Since then, their uses
have grown and HEPA filtered systems can be found in surgical theaters, clean rooms for
electronics manufacturing, and even in some homes. There are many classifications of HEPA
filters, but the most general requirement is that the filter can remove 99.7% of particulate matter
0.3 microns in diameter or larger [2].
Many advancements in filter media have been made since the initial development of HEPA
filtration, and now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory seeks to develop new materials to
be used in high temperature HEPA filtration systems. These new filter materials will require
testing in a high temperature environment, and so Cal Poly has been enlisted to build and test a
portable testing apparatus.

2.2. Scientific Literature and Trade Publications
2.2.1. HEPA Filters and Filter Testing
Flanders Precisionaire manufactures and tests high quality filters, including HEPA filters. The
trade article HEPA Filters and Filter Testing: A Comparison of Factory Tests and In-Service
Tests provided useful information about the history of HEPA filters and the appropriate types of
filters for various environments [3]. The article also detailed existing methods for testing these
filters. LLNL is seeking to develop a new kind of filter media, so while this article was helpful for
understanding various mechanisms by which filters can be tested for several qualities, it did not
provide specific information about testing environments at temperatures near the goal of this
project.

2.2.2. Air Filtration at High Temperatures
Myers’ and Melgaard’s article Air Filtration at High Temperatures in Controlled Environments
Magazine provided Team Daedalus with a detailed analysis of the challenges associated with
designing and testing HEPA filters for use in high temperature environments [4]. This
information will be of more use to project partner Sam Macy as he designs specialized gel seals
for the HEPA filters that Team Daedalus will be building a testing rig for.

[9]

2.2.3. Current Technology
There are no products on the market that precisely fit the requirements laid out by LLNL, and so
the only device featured below that would seem to be relevant for comparison to the goals of
this project is the previous MHTTU built. Despite the dearth of comparable devices, the
following section attempts to compare several commercial HEPA filter testing solutions with the
design requirements of this project. A comparison is also made between the Team Daedalus’
goals and the performance of the original MHTTU.

2.2.4. Team Phoenix: MHTTU
The original MHTTU, on which Team Daedalus’ project is based, was built in 2014 for LLNL by
ME428 group Team Phoenix. The MHTTU can be connected to a canister of compressed air
containing whatever contaminants LLNL wants to use to test their filters. The air entering the
unit is first heated by a 2 kW Watlow immersion heater, before passing through a 2kW Hot Air
Tool [1]. The reason for having two heaters was to help with heating air at low and high
flowrates. Team Phoenix found however, that the second inline heater was more detrimental
than helpful in achieving the desired temperatures.
After flowing through the heaters, the air continues through insulated round piping until it
reaches the testing chamber, which has a rectangular cross section. Inside the test chamber is
the fixture for holding samples, and is followed by the exhaust pipe. There are thermocouples
and pressure transducers before and after the test section, for verifying design parameters
during testing. There is also an anemometer for measuring air flowrates. The MHTTU will need
a redesign to meet the design specifications, the method of approach for which is outline further
on in this document.

Specification Summary [1]
•
•
•

Reaches specified air flow rates, but unable to maintain high temperatures at low flow
rates.
Meets power consumption requirements.
Cannot reach 1300 °F, but does come close at higher flowrates (approximately 1100 °F).

2.2.5. Cellular Materials International Inc.: Overhead Thermal Testing Rig
(OTTR)
The CMI OTTR is designed primarily to test joint sealants, but features high temperature air flow
as the method of testing [5], meaning it is reasonable to compare to the design specifications
from LLNL. Unfortunately, the high temperature aspect of the OTTR is the only verifiable
similarity to this project's goal. The OTTR can reach temperatures of up to 1100 °F, but CMI
provides no information regarding the range of the air flowrates it is capable of. The OTTR also
runs on two 16 kW heaters, meaning it likely requires more than 240 VAC for its power supply.
The facts that the maximum temperature of the rig is below Daedalus' desired air temperature,
no flowrate data is provided by CMI, and that the overall power requirements are too high make
the OTTR a bad fit for the goals of this project.

No information available about air flowrates.

2.2.6. Mississippi State Institute for Clean Energy Technology: Generic
Filter Test Stand
The ICET was designed at Mississippi State to perform lifecycle testing of HEPA filters,
including nuclear grade filters like the ones that LLNL will be testing with the MHTTU. Unlike the
MHTTU however, the ICET is built to test flowrates between 500 and 4000CFM [6], far
exceeding even the maximum desired flowrate desired by Team Daedalus. The ICET is also
built to be a low temperature testing apparatus, with air temperatures ranging between 60 and
140 °F [6], which also does not match the specifications for the MHTTU. The ICET is also a very
large, stationary device. Overall, the ICET is similar to the MHTTU, but the purpose of each
device is very different. The MHTTU will be for testing filter media at high temperatures but low
air flowrates, while the ICET achieves the opposite goal.

Capable flow rates of 500-4000 CFM.
Supplies 50.23 in H2O filter differential pressure.
Reaches temperatures of 60-140 °F.

[12]

2.2.7. Advanced Thermal Solutions: CLWT-115 Closed Loop Wind Tunnel
The ATS CLWT-115 is a stationary, closed loop wind tunnel for testing printed circuit boards
and other electronic components [7]. The specified range of flowrates for the CLWT-115
includes the desired range for the MHTTU, but also greatly exceeds it at the high end. This may
mean that the ability of the system to finely tune the flowrate near the bottom of its range is
limited. The CWLT-115 also does not come close to reaching the required temperature of
1300°F, and is not mobile. Despite these inconsistencies with the specifications of the MHTTU,
the air recirculation aspect of the CLWT-115 is a feature that would be attractive on the MHTTU.
Air diverted from the exhaust, perhaps feeding a heat exchanger interacting with inlet air, would
help keep temperatures high and improve total system efficiency.

Capable of flow rates of 0 to 797.4 CFM.

2.3. Department of Energy Standards for HEPA Filters
These standards are provided by the DoE to manufacturers of HEPA filters and provide
specifications for use in the design of nuclear grade HEPA filters. They also provide directions
for the manufacturing of HEPA filters and the safe handling of materials. They may not all apply
to this project, but they have been included out of caution.

2.4. Custom Heater
NiChrome wire is an alloy made from Nickel (Ni) and Chromium (Cr) in two main configurations:
NiChrome A Ni (80%) and Cr (20%), or NiChrome C Ni (60%), Cr (15%) and Fe (25%). The
main difference between these two configurations is that NiChrome C has a slightly higher
resistance per foot, but NiChrome A has a higher tensile strength [8]. NiChrome wire is widely
used in electrical appliances as a heating source because of its relatively low cost, high
conductivity, corrosion resistance and high melting temperature. Furthermore, only a few
specifications are needed to calculate the required power input for the heater; wire diameter,
wire length and desired temperature. However, further analysis of this application would be
required before implementing it in the MHTTU. Some recommended calculations would be
power requirement for the desired temperature of 1300°, power efficiency, and ease of
implementation. Nonetheless, it is a good option to consider if other modifications to the current
system fail to produce the required results.

2.5. Controls Systems
Currently the MHTTU control system is run off an Arduino micro-controller. This system is
currently lacking an interface, the ability to change testing routines mid run, and does not save
data in a useful fashion [9]. Past efforts by others to create custom printed circuit boards and
software did not prove successful. The designer responsible did not complete the work
necessary and issues were encountered trying to continue the work where it was halted, due to
poor documentation and the custom nature of the system.
Thus, it was discovered that easy-to-use and popular platforms would be better for this
application. Comprehensible code is also important so as to allow future engineers to expand
the system. A custom solution would thus be less optimal for this use, as it would be
fundamentally more complicated and harder to expand upon than an off-the-shelf controller. To
this end, the Arduino is still a good choice due to its ubiquity in the tech world, which makes it
likely that future programmers will have had experience in using it. It also benefits from the high
reliability most micro-controllers have over general purpose processors.
The Arduino is also capable of Microsoft Excel integration with the proper programing. With
further research, Gobetwino has shown promise as an easy way to export data to Excel.
Gobetwino is a PC program that uses the native serial output of the Arduino to read commands
and integrate PC side programs. Using this, the data can be easily formatted into a viewable file
[10]. The interface can also be easily developed for an Arduino, due to the variety of software
already developed for interfacing with Arduino’s. One example is MakerPlot, which is a
commercial solution which integrates data collection and a programmable GUI control system.
Other solutions are also available and a custom solution is also an option.

[14]

2.6. Insulation
The current system utilize mineral wool as means of insulation and it is made from molten glass,
stone or slag that is spun into a fiber-like structure. Inorganic rock or slag are the main
components (typically 98%) of stone wool. The remaining 2% organic content is generally a
thermosetting resin binder and a little oil [11]. The relationship between temperature and
thermal conductivity is indicated in the diagram below:

Figure 5. Performance of Mineral Wool Insulation [11].
After a more detail research, ceramic wool insulation has proven to perform better than mineral
wool for the specific application of this system. The different parameters considered to compare
both insulations were: thermal conductivity coefficient, maximum temperature of application,
ease of application, and cost. The results of this comparison using 1000 °F as a reference
temperature can be seen in Table 3 below.

Team Daedalus has decided to purchase Ceramic Fiber Blanket from the supplier Ceramic
Fiber Online. This vendor was chosen because their website offered a great deal of information
about the fiber, as well as competitive pricing. The exact material chosen was 8lb/in3 Zirconia
Grade Fiber Spun Blanket, because it offers the best thermal properties for its price.

3. Design Development
3.1. Discussion of Conceptual Designs
Team Daedalus has determined that the best way to complete this project successfully is to
start by analyzing the system as it currently exists before making any concrete design decisions.
Since Team Phoenix’s MHTTU was operational and just did not meet the design specifications,
the first goal is to reconnect the control system and perform tests to determine the exact
performance specifications of the MHTTU. Once hard data has been collected, deliberation
about the issues with the current design and possible solutions can begin. Some examples of
design techniques to be utilized in this phase are Brainstorming, Brainwriting and the
SCAMPER method.
Although preliminary testing to the MHTTU has not been possible due to the lack of proper
documentation from previous teams, Team Daedalus began the design process with
Brainwriting. In this early design process, the whole system was broken down into its most basic
functions such as heating, airflow, control system and data collection. Then, writing down all
possible ideas for each system in periods of five minutes, Team Daedalus collected several
options for each function. At this point of the design process, feasibility, quality or efficiency
were not a concern because it was more important to collect as many options as possible to
later refine them. An example of the Brainwriting is shown in Figure 5 below.

Figure 6. Example of first design process session, Brainwriting, showing
ideas generated for control system.
After Brainwriting, Team Daedalus decided to have a Brainsketching session. During
Brainsketching all ideas for the different systems were recorded, but every three minutes the
team members had to rotate the logbooks that ideas were being recorded in, so other members
could build upon the previous teammate ideas. This method was not limited to writing down the
ideas, but it included sketching ideas if so desired. Likewise, the objective of this methodology

[16]

was to generate as many ideas as possible for the different function, so there were no bad or
wrong ideas. Figure 6 below exemplifies the outcomes of this method.

Figure 7. Example of Brainsketching for heating function

3.2. Design Iteration Process
Concept modeling was a third attempt to generate more feasible ideas. In this session, each
team member took previous ideas for each function and tried to build a quick prototype with a
few materials including FoamCore, plastic straws, rubber bands, rope, dowels, popsicle sticks,
tape and hot glue. This method was useful for combining previous ideas with an examination of
the practicality of implementing them in the current system. Different prototypes developed in
this session are described below.

3.2.1. Heat Exchanger
An option that was investigated for viability, effectiveness and cost was implementing a heat
exchanger to divert the waste heat coming out of the exhaust to preheat the low temperature air
entering the heater. Preheating the air entering the heater would decrease the heater power
demand and increase the overall efficiency of the system. Although it is acknowledged that
perfect exchange of heat is impossible, a heat exchanger may prove to improve efficiency when
paired with a proper system [11]. The model of the heat exchanger is depicted in Figure 8.

[17]

Figure 8. Heat exchanger prototype

3.2.2. Increasing Surface Area of Immersion Heater
Another idea to increase the effectiveness of the system was to increase the surface area of the
heating element in the immersion heater. The purpose of increasing the surface area of the
heating element is to maximize the area where heat exchange takes place. Similar to a fin/fan
system, increasing the surface area available for heat dissipation will result in more heat
convection from the heater into the air flowing over it. The current heater installed in the MHTTU
is capable of reaching a maximum temperature of 1600°F, so this option looks to maximize the
heating ability by adding fins made of a highly thermally conductivity material. Several aspects
of this idea that would limit the feasibility include finding a material that can be welded onto the
sheath metal of the heater, the possibility that the heat from welding the fins onto the heater
would damage it, the geometries of the pipe and heater. A model of this option is depicted in
Figure 9.

Figure 9. Increasing surface area of immersion heater
by adding thin sheet metal strips to heating rod.

[18]

3.2.3. Custom Heater
Other option considered during ideation was to build a custom heater by wrapping NiChrome
wire around an insulating support structure. Running current through the wire causes it to heat
up to very high temperatures. Air flowing over the wire would be heated by convection. The
amount of surface area for convection that can be achieved with this design is much higher than
with the current immersion heater. An example of the custom heater prototype is shown in
Figure 10.

Figure10. Prototype of custom built heater with
NiChrome wire as a heating resistance

3.2.4. Electric Band Heater
One of the known problems with the current MHTTU is that the testing chamber only reaches
about 700°F, even though the immersion heater is capable of reaching up to 1600°F. Team
Microfire suggested implementing an electric band heater around the testing chamber to
increase the temperature inside the chamber. Further analysis and confirmation from
electricians confirms that it will be possible to run the band heater in parallel with the immersion
heater. Team Daedalus is working on the approval to get the current unit started up to run more
physical tests. In order for Cal Poly to authorize starting the MHTTU, a risk analysis document,
a power system diagram and a circuit diagram are required, documents that were not provided
by previous teams. During the process of laying down the power system diagram, a few wires
were found that didn’t seem to lead to any known components. Following those wires, Team
Daedalus found that Team MicroFire installed electrical band heaters around the testing
chamber but failed to document this on their report. Additionally, their static testing results do
not reflect the addition of the band heaters. Therefore, Team Daedalus has chosen to initially
disregard Team MicroFire’s efforts to include the band heaters, and if necessary, further testing
will be performed to determine the effectiveness of band heater. Figure 11 depicts a prototype
of the addition of electrical band heaters to the testing chamber.

[19]

Figure 11. Prototype of the addition of electrical band heater to the testing chamber

3.2.5. Cylindrical Testing Chamber
Again, one of the main concerns for Team Daedalus is the fact that the air flowing through the
current testing chamber cannot reach the required temperature. One potential factor identified
was deficiencies with the current geometry. An early theory points to an inadequate
interconnection between the outlet of the heater and the inlet of the testing chamber, causing
heat leaks. Therefore, a cylindrical testing chamber is being considered, for which half of the
cylinder can be detached for easy access to the sample fixture. Another possible fix is a sliding
sample fixture that can be easily inserted or removed from the testing chamber.
A complete redesign of the testing chamber poses its own problems, however. The chamber
and the heating system represent the efforts of two entire ME Senior Project teams, and
effecting major changes to both systems may be too great a task for 9 months. It is more
important that the testing chamber reach the desired temperature than it is to improve the ease
with which samples are inserted and removed. A total change to the chamber geometry would
also necessitate repeating any thermal analysis done by Team Phoenix and Team MicroFire to
determine the air flow and heat transfer characteristics of new geometries. FEA and CFD
models, along with conventional analytical examination, will provide objective evidence for the
ultimate decision regarding the chamber geometry. A prototype of the cylindrical testing
chamber with its respective detachable sample fixture can be found in Figure 12.

3.3. Decision Matrix Development
As seen in previous sections, Team Daedalus performed several design methods to produce
many options as possible to improve the current MHTTU. Even though not every idea is feasible
or optimal, it helped to investigate different approaches that can be further explored to return the
best possible solution. After collecting all the possible options, they had to be reduced to one or
two most suitable options. To accomplish this, Team Daedalus built Pugh matrices for each
function annotating all possible solutions and comparing how well they would fulfill the
engineering specifications. Pugh matrices for all four functions can be seen in Appendix B and
Table 3 identifies different solutions for each function.

After analyzing individual solutions for all four different functions, they were put together in a
decision matrix to represent the best possible components and to simulate the overall design.
The different combinations considered were:
•

Datum - Electronically control valve, PID control Arduino, Wat-low heater and Arduino

Option A - Electronically control valve, Remote Arduino control, NiChrome wire heater,
remote collecting data.

It is important to recognize that the Datum scored considerably lower than other options
because of the lack of a control system, and exporting and storing data and inadequate heating.
Also, options B and D scored similar because of their lower power requirements, easy
adjustment, and relatively simple interface.
Since this is the second iteration for the MHTTU, Team Daedalus had decided to proceed with
suggestion for improvement stated by previous teams, with upgrades requested by LLNL, and
with improvements observed by Team Daedalus. These improvements include investigating
heat leakage sources and removing the higher flow heat torch currently installed. Because the
immersion heater is capable to reach up to 1600°F, Team Daedalus considered it of extreme
importance to identify heat leakage in the system to maintain the desired temperature
throughout the system. Also, the high flow heater would have been removed because high flow
rates are not required for this system and the power limitation does not allow for both heaters to
run at the same time. At the moment, heat leakage points to inadequate application of
insulations, bad integration of viewports, and poor interconnection between outlet of heating
pipe and inlet to the testing chamber. Dr. Hughes, professor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, will
provide Team Daedalus with thermal cameras, FLIR Photo-640, that will be used to identify heat
leaks in the system. As mentioned before, the testing chamber only reaches a maximum
temperature of 700°F when the heater itself reaches higher temperature. Therefore, in a big part
the heat leaks contribute to a poor system. After identifying and fixing all heat leaks, the team
would have proceeded to test the overall performance of the system and verify that the
customer requirements are met or exceed.
If performing thermal studies in the MHTTU and fixing heat leaks, insulation and unnecessary
equipment are not sufficient to bring the MHTTU to optimal operating conditions, an iterative
process was to be implemented. This iterative process would have included the addition of band
heaters, increases in the surface area of the current heater by attaching fins to the heating rods,

[22]

implementing a new heater, include a heat exchanger, and possibly extensive modifications to
the testing chamber.
The addition of band heaters to the testing chamber will be the next improvement because of its
relative low cost, potential high benefits, and simple implementation. This option follows the fact
that the testing chamber cannot reach the desired temperature, even though the emerging
heater is capable to output more than 1300°F. It was estimated that including band heaters will
reduce the temperature gradient between the heater and the testing chamber. It can also be
used as a pre-heating mechanism, and in return it will minimize the heat up time helping to
accomplish a customer requirement. Thermal analysis would have then validated the final
decision to incorporate band heater in the system.
A third step improving performance of the MHTTU would have been to increase the surface
area of the heating rods. This increment in surface area would have been accomplished by
attaching thin plates of highly conductive material to the heating rods of the heater. The
objective of the thin plates would be to simulate fins helping with the heat transfer from the
heater to the fluid, air. It is still necessary to investigate if it is possible to weld any material to
the rods, or a holding mechanism will be implemented to keep the fins in place.
A further implementation to the system, if the previous upgrades did not prove to be sufficient,
would have been to replace the immersion heater with a more adequate heater for this
application. As team Phoenix mentioned on their report, immersion heater’s main application is
to heat up static fluids. A more careful investigation on different heaters determined that there
are non-expensive, more specific for the application heaters. One option would have been the
Daisy Wound Heating Element. This heater is specific for low flow rates, high temperatures
applications, and low power input. This was an option within the budget, but this idea was not
approved by the sponsor.
Also, implementation of the control system with an Arduino micro-controller would have been a
priority in early stages of the process. An Arduino micro-controller was selected for this
application because it is capable of being inexpensively expanded to include extra features such
as wireless communication, touchscreen/controller integration and graphics output. It is also
capable of Microsoft Excel integration with the proper program. Having this flexibility would have
aided in getting the control system to a level that satisfies our specifications. Also, it was
recognized that a well-documented control system is desired for this application.

3.4. Safety Review and Operating Procedure
Due to the MHTTU’s high voltage power system, and high temperatures of the heating element
and the air leaving the test chamber, safety is a critical component of design and operation. To
this effect, Team Daedalus has completed a review of the system components and compiled
analysis of potential risks as well as strategies for mitigating those risks. It is impossible to
predict every eventuality, but the assessment provided represents the best efforts of Team
Daedalus to ensure that proper and sufficient safety procedures are followed while operating the
MHTTU.

4. Description of Final Design
4.1. Overall Design Description
After investigating possible modifications to the existing MHTTU and discussing them with our
sponsor, it was concluded that the best path forward was to work toward the mitigation of heat
loss from the testing chamber. To minimize heat losses, new methods of insulation on the cold
side of the MHTTU were investigated, along with modifying the inside surface of the testing
chamber to decrease the ability of the stainless steel to absorb heat meant for the test section.
Additionally, geometric modifications were investigated, including removing as much mass as
possible from the test chamber and test section, to decrease the ability of the assembly to
absorb heat from the process air, and dissipate it to the ambient air.

4.1.1. Power System
Due to concerns on the part of Cal Poly staff regarding safety issues in the current system, the
decision was made by staff that it would be necessary to have a contractor to building the power
systems of the MHTTU. The primary concern of the staff at Cal Poly was that the existing
system has no built in protections against the immersion heater faulting to ground. Another
issue in the way of Team Daedalus redesigning the power system themselves is a safety
regulation on campus that states that any wiring meant to carry over 50 V must be done by a
certified electrician. Because any power system designed and implemented by undergraduate
students would likely need multiple revisions, it was determined that hiring an electrician to
come to campus multiple times would be cost prohibitive.
To solve this issue, Cal Poly and Team Daedalus are working with Aaron Peri of Sierra Pacific
Automation, a local contractor in Paso Robles, CA. The specifications for the power system can
be found in Appendices C and D. It is meant to operate essentially as a black box from the
point of view of Team Daedalus and the eventual end user. The power system will plug into
240V AC outlets at Cal Poly and handle a maximum of 20 Amps of current. It will contain 240 V
female plugs as outputs, so that the heater(s) may be swapped in and out at will. It will also
feature center positive 2.1 mm female DC plugs, to power the Arduino based control system, as
well as the sensors used for control.

4.1.2. Geometry Modifications
4.1.2.1. Viewport Modification
Early in the progression of this project, the Tate Jones viewports purchased by Team MicroFire
for their testing assembly were identified as a likely source of heat dissipation from the system.
This suspicion was driven by two key factors, the first being the relatively large mass of the
viewports compared to the rest of the system. Each viewport weighs about 6.5 lb., while the rest
of the assembly weighs about 18 lb. This means that the viewports account for about 40% of the
mass of the system. The more mass that the testing assembly has that is thermally linked to the
hot air flowing through it, the more heat will be absorbed by the assembly and dissipated. It was
determined that reducing the size of the viewport through machining processes would
significantly decrease the amount of thermal mass in the system, and help keep the
temperature of the process air at the desired level. Calculations and analysis supporting this
claim can be found in Appendix I. A CAD model can be seen below in figure 15 and in Appendix
H.

Figure 15. Comparison between current and modified sight glass

[27]

4.1.2.2.

Test Chamber Modifications

It was also determined that the test chamber would need modification. Based on the thermal
analysis performed in the system, see Appendix I for detail, it was found that the test chamber
leading into the test section was another likely source of heat loss. This thermal analysis
consisted in comparing the viewport threads to a fin in the system acting as a heatsink. Also, the
overall thermal mass of the system was accounted to demonstrate the heat capacity of the
system. With these calculations, it was found that the system was capable to dissipate 1500
BTU/hr., and the overall heat input to the system was 3300 BTU/hr. MicroFire found that the
temperature in the test section dropped below the temperature of the air leaving the heater pipe.
Because the first thermocouple used to determine the temperature drop across the test
chambers and section is about halfway through the inlet test chamber, Team Daedalus
concluded that the test chamber deserved investigation.
The results of the analysis mentioned above led us to decide on a partial re-design of the inlet
test chamber. Because the viewport for the inlet test chamber was being drastically reduced in
cross sectional area, the new test chamber could be smaller than the current one. It could also
be shorter. This would mean there is less mass in the test assembly, and therefore less heat
capacity. Technical drawings of the new inlet test chamber can be seen below in figure 16 and
in Appendix H.

Figure 16. Comparison between current and modified test chamber inlet

4.1.3. Controls
The control system will primarily consist of an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller board and a
laptop connected by a serial USB connection. The Arduino handles all sensor and relay I/O in
the testing unit, while the laptop renders a GUI for the user to interact with, sends commands to
the Arduino and receives sensor data back. The laptop is necessary for the Arduino does not
have sufficient capabilities to render a GUI that satisfies all the requirements.

[28]

In order to implement this control protocol, both the Laptop and Arduino will need to run their
own individual program. On the Laptop side, the control program is known as Instrumentino and
on the Arduino, the control program is known as Controlino.

Figure 17. Control system overview.
Another program, “Gobetwino”, was initially considered for the control system as mentioned in
the preliminary report. Gobetwino implements a general-purpose protocol, which can interface
an Arduino with a variety of software, including Excel. However, this path was abandoned
because Gobetwino lacks the functionality to construct a custom GUI, make test routines and
save/load test routines. Another concern was with the quality of the software, because it has
never received an update past the initial beta release, staying stagnant since 2011. The testing
done on it is also thin, having not been tested on newer versions of Windows or for extended
periods of time. [21] This greatly increases the likelihood of a hard to find and difficult to fix bug.

4.1.3.1.

Instrumentino

Three chemistry department members of the University of Basel developed Instrumentino as a
modular framework for the implementation of custom GUIs for Arduino based experimental
instruments. Written in Python, the project is open source, licensed under GPL, and has been in
development for 2 years. The developers have been publishing periodic updates, with the most
recent published Jun 21, 2016 and a version 2 is under development as well. It has been
utilized for many applications by the developers, including as a four channel MFC control box,
and by other higher educational institutions. [22]

[29]

Figure 18. Example GUI
The program was chosen because it satisfies many of our requirements. As shown in Figure 18,
Instrumentino offers a simple to use interface and even allows for direct input via toggles and
read-outs. A major feature is the built in “STOP” button, which implements the requirement for
our system to allow tests to be stopped mid-run and, if desired, a new routine loaded. The
framework also offers numerical input, which will be utilized in controlling the air flow and
temperature.
Instrumentino supports the requirement for predefined testing routine though a hierarchy of
actions, methods and sequences.
• Actions refer to all the preprogramed functions available to the user.
o Examples of actions would include “Set Heater Temp”, “Set Air Valve
Percentage”, and “Wait”.
• Methods are a series of actions, where individual actions are called and given
parameters.
o Examples of predefined methods would include “Startup Sequence”, “Test Max
Temp” and “Cooldown”.
o New methods can be defined, saved and loaded in the GUI.
• Sequences are a series of methods to be run one after the other.
o New sequences can be defined, saved and loaded in the GUI.
o Each desired predefined test routine can be implemented as a saved
sequence.
With this organization, skilled users can easily implement new tests and modify existing tests in
the field.

[30]

Excel Output

The system is required to support data exportation via Excel. Instrumentino handles this natively

Controlino

Controlino is the Arduino side control program, which was developed to integrate with
Instrumentino. Written in C, it was also developed by the same team from Basel. It primarily
receives messages sent to it over the USB serial connection and calls the appropriate function.
Features:
• Parses the serial connection for text commands and parameters
• Pre-integrated PID Libraries
• Includes prewritten functions for basic actions
• Supports the addition of libraries to control new peripherals

4.1.3.4.

Custom Communications Test

In order to confirm that Controlino was a sufficient choice, initial work was done to integrate the
MAX31855 thermocouple board’s functions into the Controlino protocol. Integrating one function
would be sufficient evidence for the functionality of the program, for all additional functions are
added in a similar manner. This also test also seeks to confirm the functionality of the chip with
our thermocouples, which was a concern.
The program consists of primarily of a single file, “Controlino.ino”. As a credit to the developers,
the code can immediately be seen as well commented and organized. Since the MAX31855 has
C library support, its functions can be utilized by Controlino. To do this, #include the header file
“Adafruit_MAX31855.h” into the Controlino code.

[31]

Then, a custom function must be declared. This function will later be called once the serial
command relating to it is sent. The function should handle whatever task is asked from it within
its body and send any return values over serial.
• For example :
void cmdTempRead(int argC, char **argV) {
double Temp;
if(strcasecmp("C",argV[1]) == 0){
Temp = Thermocouple1.readCelsius();
}
else if(strcasecmp("F",argV[1]) == 0){
Temp = Thermocouple1.readFarenheit();
}
else {
Serial.println("Invalid argument. Usage : TempRead [C/F]");
return;
}
Serial.println(Temp);
return;
}

Next, the program checks if the serial port has a message waiting and if so, compares the
passed in text with a series of predefined commands. To implement a new function, the if-else if
block must have a new strcasecmp case, where strcasecmp compares argV[0] to the desired
function command text. The else-if case must then call the desired function and pass any
needed variables.
• For example :
else if (strcasecmp(argV[0], "TempRead") == 0) {
cmdTempRead(argC, argV);
}

The given example above was implemented along with the needed electrical components. The
serial command “TempRead F” and “TempRead C” were given to the Arduino. The system
successfully returned the room temp in both F and C and showed a related increase in temp
once the thermocouple was held.
Due to the success of this fundamental test, we have high confidence in our ability to deliver a
GUI and control scheme that meets the project requirements.

4.2. Material, Geometry and Component Selection
4.2.1. Refractory Cement
The team has not yet chosen a vendor for refractory cement, as it has been difficult to track
down accurate numbers for heat transfer co-efficient values. In the budget, CRSCOTE 3000
WET was selected as a placeholder product, because it comes from the same vendor as the
ceramic fiber blanket will, which would make logistics a bit easier to manage. Once the team
determines the best brand of refractory cement to purchase, both from a price perspective and a
material properties perspective, the line item budget will be updated to reflect this.

[32]

4.2.2. Cost Analysis
As of the writing of this document, a full budget cannot be compiled because the team has not
received a quote for the cost of the power system. Despite that, a list of currently anticipated
costs can be found in table 7 below.
The largest cost is expected to be the power system, but efforts have been made to defray as
much of that cost as possible. Mr. Peri has been asked to use as many of the original
components as he can, and the team has offered to drop off and pick up the system, to avoid
being charged for transportation. In addition to the unknown cost of Mr. Peri’s services, the
team has made room in the budget to hire a Cal Poly Shop Tech to assist with welding the test
chamber assembly. Welding stainless steel is difficult in the best of scenarios, and the
geometry of the test chamber may make the task too difficult. Cal Poly Shop Techs hire out for
$28 per hour, and the team has set aside money to cover 6 hours of Tech time. It is not
expected that the welding job will take 6 hours for an experienced welder, but the team felt it
was important to err on the side of caution. Also, considering that the current costs are well
below the total budget, the extra cost is more than bearable.

5. Product Realization
Because the main focus of team Daedalus was to renovate and improve previous attempts to
build the MHTTU, the manufacturing of the system was tailored to new test chamber, new
chamber inlet and outlet, and modification of the viewport glass. The manufacturing plan for the
MHTTU can be seen in figure 21 below.

5.1. Viewport Modifications
The test chamber design from Team Microfire contained a custom size Tate Jones Peepsight
for a viewport. It was determined to be necessary as part of the redesign of the test chamber to
modify the viewport by removing as much material as possible. In the current system, the
viewport is threaded into a modified pipe flange, which is welded onto the front face of the
assembly. The mass of the peepsight and the flange it is fitted into represent a large fraction of
the mass of the overall system. According to the thermal analysis performed in the system,
removing as much mass from the peepsight, and changing the way that it is affixed to the
assembly will decrease the ability of the test chamber inlet to act as a heat sink.
With the help of professor Georgeou from the IME department, the hexagonal face of the first
viewport, which represents a large portion of the mass of the viewport itself, was turned down to
a smaller diameter using a CNC lathe. This operation took approximately one hour and thirty
minutes. In order to turn down that face, the quartz viewing lens was removed from the
viewport, so that it is not damaged by machining operations.
The hexagonal face of the second viewport was turned down using the manual lathe in the
Mustang ’60 Machine Shop and the Aero Hangar. This is due to the lack of CNC certification to
operate the HAAS machines available in both shops. The total machining time to turn down the
hexagonal face of the second viewport was approximately two and a half hours. The cutting
speed of the manual lathe was 200 RPM and a feed rate of 0.030 IPM. Coolant and a carbide
turning tool were used during this operation because of the hardness of the steel viewport
material. The modified viewport can be seen in Figure 22.

Figure 22. Modified viewport
To complete the changes in the viewport, the threaded pipe portion of the first viewport was
faced down using a CNC lathe and the second viewport was faced down using the manual
lathe. The main complication to face down the threads was the material of the viewports. Since
it is stainless steel, the feed rate was 0.030 IPM and the cutting speed was 200 RPM. These
rates were selected to prevent damage to the tool, as well as chatter, and ensuring a proper
surface finish. This operation alone took one hour of machining. Because the peepsight glass
can be accessed by unthreading the external ring, the viewport was permanently attached to the

[35]

test chamber, and it will still be accessible for possible maintenance of the quartz glass. As
previously discussed, the threads of the viewport were compared to the effect of fins inside the
test chamber acting as a heat sink. Also, the pipe fitting welded to the testing chamber was
completely removed from the modified testing chamber, decreasing the thermal mass of the
system by a 52%.

5.2. Manufacturing of Modified Inlet Test Chamber
5.2.1. Waterjet Cut Outlines of Sheet Parts
Team Daedalus had a large piece of 12 gage sheet steel, approximately 4’ by 6’, left behind by
a previous MHTTU team. This leftover stock was used to construct the modified inlet and outlet
test chambers, and the testing section. After the CAD’s drawings were completed, a PDX file
was created to upload in the ITE’s water jet cutter. Then, the sheet metal was placed in the
water jet cutter bed, and the program was loaded and initialized. The water jet cutter process
was fully automated, and it took approximately 45 minutes.

Figure 23. Water jet cutter process
Figure 23 is a picture of the water jet cutter on campus, located in building 21-136, used to cut
out the outlines of the pieces of the inlet and outlet testing chamber, and the testing section to
be welded together. The outline pieces of the assembly were cut so that when welded, edges
welding will have to be use to attach them together.

5.2.2. Bend the Sheet for the Central Body Portion of the Inlet Test
Chamber
The thickness of the sheet metal is 0.060 in., and the maximum thickness allowed in the pan
brake tables located in the ME shops is 0.060 in; therefore, the bending process of the sheet
metal was performed in the hangar shop. To prepare the parts to be bent, the pieces of sheet
previously cut with the water jet cutter were measured with a ruler and marked with a sharpie for
[36]

easy identification during the bending process. The pieces of sheet metal were cut thinking to
minimize the amount of bents needed to achieve the final assembly; therefore, only four
different pieces were needed to bent. Two pieces were the bottom and side walls of the test
chambers, and the other two pieces were the walls of the test section that needed to be bent 90
degrees.

5.2.3. Welding Procedure
Due to the difficulty of welding thin sheets of stainless steel, Team Daedalus arranged for a Cal
Poly welding instructor, Kevin Todd Williams, to complete the welding for the inlet and outlet test
chambers, and the test sections; however, there were several setbacks during manufacturing
that reduced the time to complete the system. Since Mr. Williams was donating his personal
time to complete the welding, it was going to take more time than it was possible. Therefore, the
welding was outsourced to Gentry Welding shop, where Chris Gentry completed the welding
process. The welding included: edge welding of all the sheet metal pieces for the inlet test
chamber, outlet test chamber and the test section. It also included inlet and outlet tubing to
connect the chambers to the rest of the system, the tabs used to clamp the system together,
and viewports. The finished inlet chamber with all of its components can be seen in Figure 24.

Figure 24. Modified Inlet Test Chamber

[37]

5.2.4. Application of Insulation
After research of the benefits of high temperature refractory cement and ceramic wool
insulation, it was decided to include these two methods of insulation in the system.
Once the welding process was completed and the chambers were accessible, the high
temperature refractory cement was applied to the interior of the inlet test chamber, test
section and outlet test chamber. The main objective of the refractory cement is to
decrease the conductivity coefficient to minimize heat dissipation by conduction. Also, it
decreases the losses by radiation to the chambers. To apply the refractory cement, the
directions included by the manufacturer were followed, and it was left to cure for 48
hours before any heat cycle, see Figure 25 for an illustration of the process.

Figure 25. Application of High Temperature Refractory Cement
Once the refractory cement was completely cured, the ceramic wool insulation was
applied. The application started by cutting the ceramic wool blanket to specified
dimensions of the chambers and heater tubing. Then, the insulation was held in place
by tying it with tie wire of 18 gauge. Finally, the insulation was covered with a layer of
adhesive mesh drywall joint tape and cover by three layers of plaster. This method was
used to accomplish a finish that would allow future modification, but at the same time
provided consistency, support, and coverage for the insulation. The application process
for the ceramic insulation can be seen below in figure 26.

5.2.5. Data Recording Devices
The final step of the assembly process was to install the measurement devices that consist of
three thermocouples and two pitot-tubes. The three thermocouples used to monitor the
temperature during testing are located one in the heater coils, the second in the inlet test
chamber and the third in the test section chamber. The two pitot-tubes used to calculate the
pressure differential of the system are located one in the inlet test chamber and the other in the
outlet test chamber.

[39]

5.3. Assembly of Control System
There were no parts for the control system that needed manufacturing, and at most consisted of
simple soldering of pins or wires. Figure 27 shows the initial, hand drawn wiring diagram for the
system.

Figure 27. Initial wiring diagram
This wiring diagram is primarily useful to illustrate how components other than the Arduino are
to be connected to power sources. The Arduino connections were changed due to only certain
pins being able to output a PWM signal and to utilize the default SPI pins (Digital pins 13, 12
and 11). These new connections are illustrated in Figure 28.

Figure 28. Updated Arduino Board Connections
[40]

The wiring was also planned to be soldered on to a protoboard so as to ensure security of the
connections. This was not realized for we never got to tuning and finalizing the electrical
system, and were under an immense time crunch to get some testing in. To this end, the wiring
was done with breadboards for its speed of construction and modification.
Breadboard construction does not lead to very high quality or secure wiring. However, it was
decided that some data and testing was better than none.
For future teams, it is highly recommended that they finalize the control wiring, by soldering to a
protoboard, once they have verified and tuned it.

5.4. Hardware Changes to Realized Prototype vs. Final Design
During the critical design report the inlet test chamber and outlet test chamber were to be
modified by removing material from non-critical areas as are the corners of the chambers;
however, after the presentation to sponsor, Erik Brown, it was concluded that the orientation of
the test sampler was not a limitation. Therefore, the test section chamber was modified
changing the orientation to a vertical position. By changing the orientation of the test section, the
inlet and outlet test chamber could be modified to remove the sloped area leading to the test
section. Since the slop was removed, the extra material could be removed further decreasing
the thermal mass of the system. This final modification reduced the weight of the inlet and outlet
test chamber by 52%. Also, further conversation with Sam Macy led the team to modified the
test section chamber dimension to accommodate sample material.

5.5. Control System Changes to Realized Prototype vs. Final Design
The control system was not able to be realized to the final design. The fundamental issue was a
matter of timing, where due to delays on the power system, little time was available to construct,
tune and test the controls. The GUI is operational but its communication protocol with the
Arduino either has a bug or our utilization of it is faulty. Due to this, no testing or tuning was
possible with the originally developed GUI control system.
As a workaround, an Arduino program was developed in order to allow us to test the maximum
temperature and heat up time. Unlike the GUI, the testing program is run though a serial
terminal and only accepts the runtime and which heaters to use. It then runs the selected
heaters at maximum power for the time specified and prints the temperature of the test chamber
air and the heater coil every minute.
Mass air flow and pressure differential data could potentially be collected, for they are simply a
voltage to be read by an Arduino analog pin. However, due to a lack of time, we were unable to
calibrate the sensors. Therefore, any voltage reading would be meaningless for we do not know
how the voltages map to real world conditions. Because of this, these sensor readings were not
collected.

6. Design Verification
Due to the problems that were encounter with the controls system, only the maximum
temperature and heat-up time tests were able to be run. There was useful data collected
however.

[41]

6.1. Maximum Temperature and Warm-Up Time Test of Main
Heater Only
The purpose of this test was to determine the time needed to reach 1000°F and the maximum
reachable temperature of the system, given any amount of time, using only the main immersion
heater. This was achieved by manually setting the flow and running the main heater at
maximum power, while polling the temperatures of the heater coils and test chamber every
minute.

6.1.1. Test Results
Because of the inability to accurately measure the air flow rate during the test, the air pressure
had to be manually adjusted with the pressure valve. Although previous calculations indicated
that 12 ACFM correspond to 1.5 psi, the pressure valve was manually set to 10 psi to obtain a
baseline test. This pressure was selected due to the equipment limitations and maximum
resolution. The pressure valve has a resolution of ±2.5 psi, and the air cleaner/dryer has a
minimum operating pressure of approximately 2.5 psi.
Therefore, the air pressure in the first test was set to 10 psi and the heater was operated at full
load at all times. During this test the temperatures at the heater coils and the inlet test chamber
were recorded until it reached a steady temperature of 900 °F and 480 °F, respectively. This
test was performed for 12 minutes. After the system reached a steady state, the air pressure
was reduced to 5 psi to observe the new maximum temperature. The maximum temperatures
under these conditions were recorded to be 1200 °F in the heater coils and 660 °F in the inlet
test chamber after 10 minutes of air flow.
Lastly, the air pressure was dropped to its minimum pressure allowed by the equipment of
approximately 2.5 psi. With this air pressure, the maximum temperature measured at the heater
coils was 1540 °F, and the maximum recorded temperature in the inlet test chamber was 835°F.
these temperatures were recorded after 45 minutes of testing, and the data collected can be
observed bellow in figure 29.

6.2. Maximum Temperature and Warm-Up Time Test of Main
Heater and Band Heater
The purpose of this test was to determine the time needed to reach 1000°F and the maximum
reachable temperature of the system, given any amount of time, using both the band and main
immersion heater. This test also will reveal if the band heater has any appreciable effect on the
heating performance of the system. Again, we manually set the flow and ran both the main
heater and band heater at maximum power, while polling the temperatures of the heater coils
and test chamber every minute. This test differed from the main heater only test in that at this
point, the Arduino testing program had been written and so the procedure became automated.

6.2.1. Test Results
Again, due to not being able to digitally adjust the flow, we manually set the psi with the psi
gauge. For this test we set the psi to the minimum needed to keep the air cleaner/dryer from
venting. Because of this, we are unsure of the exact psi for the gauge did not have enough
resolution to display such a low reading. The motivation behind this was to test the system with
the lowest flow possible without using the digital control valve, so as to achieve the highest
temperature possible in the lowest time. As shown in the chart, which has the data embedded
so it can be hovered over in MS Word for exact values, the chamber was only able to get to
699.8°F while the heater was at 1376.6°F. While still failing, this was a major improvement from
test one where the system reached only 495°F at the chamber and 934°F at the heater. Thus
this test leads us to a 41.3% increase in the temperature achievable in 15 min. Also, the system
reached approximately the test one maximum temperature of 837°F but in only 25 minutes
instead of 40 minutes, leading to a 60% increase in heating speed.

Unfortunately, we cannot determine how much of this improvement came from the introduction
of the band heater and how much from the low flow rate. We hypothesize that it is a

[43]

combination of both and that low or no flow conditions with the band heater should be the next
set of tests to be done.

6.3. Uncertainty and Error Propagation
Since the two previous tests only have one source of data, without any calculations done on
them, the uncertainty is equal to the uncertainty of the thermocouple which is ±0.75% of the
value reported. This was based on data provided by the manufacturer, Omega. Again, since
there is only one variable and no functions they are being used in, there is no error propagation
and the error of the whole system is equal to the error of the thermocouple stated above of
±0.75%.

7. Conclusions and Recommendations
Unfortunately, Team Daedalus was not successful in accomplishing a system that meets the
specifications of Lawrence Livermore. The primary catalyst for the failure was the 2 quarter long
delay in getting a working power system that was safety approved for on campus power-up.
The control system remains incomplete as of the end of senior project, so our primary
suggestion is to complete the debugging of the code. We suggest future teams start with
figuring out how to get the Arduino to return a value to Instrumentino though serial. Then we
suggest modifying the PID library to accept an integer rather than poll a voltage.
From the testing that was done, we hypothesize that our modifications, while they did improve
the thermal capabilities of the system, did not address every heat leak in the system. Little heat
was felt leaving though the insulated parts, though there were a few areas that did feel hotter
than others. These places could do with more insulation to prevent heat losses, but the effect
would probably be minimal. We would suggest for future teams to perform FLIR or other thermal
camera testing to see where heat leaks are.
In our testing though, major amounts of heat were found to be leaving the system though the
brackets that join each section together, so one recommendation we make to future teams is to
explore the possibility of either welding the inlet test section to the heater section to remove the
need for the brace, or simply insulating the brace.
Team Daedalus also was investigating alternative heaters that were more specialized at heating
air. The idea behind that was since the immersion heater is designed for stagnant liquids, that
flowing air would not be able to fully utilize the heaters energy due to a small surface area.
Should further insulate improvements still not produce the desired results, we strongly
recommend that future teams look into alternative heaters. This was hypothesized by team
Daedalus, but due to lack of evidence and a high cost we were not able to get sponsor approval
to buy a new heater.

Preliminary System Testing (Max Temp and Heat-up Time)

The preliminary system does not have an integrated control system. The system is pre-configured to run
at max heater output, with a manually adjusted flow and manually swapped temperature testing
location.
Caution: Do not turn on power to the system until shop air is connected and flowing.
1) Complete the pre-power up checklist. Report any failures and cease operation if any failures found.
2) Don all protective gear (Gloves, Googles and Mask) .
3) Attach shop-air and 240v power inputs.
4) Start a small flow.
5) Manually adjust shop air via PSI gauge near input to desired PSI
6) Turn the testing unit’s power switch to on.
7) Apply 5v to the positive control wire and GDN to the common of the desired heater/heaters and
begin timing.
8) Use an Arduino serial monitor to monitor temperature, polling every minute and ensuring the
desired location is attached to thermocouple port 1.
a) Attach the test chamber thermocouple to port 1.
b) Issue serial commands "TempRead F 1" or 'TempRead C 1" to return temperature of the test
chamber.
c) Attach the immersion heater coil thermocouple.
d) Issue serial commands "TempRead F 1" or 'TempRead C 1" to return temperature of the
immersion heater coil.
e) Repeat every minute for 15 Min to see if heat-up time is meet.
f) Continue until 1000°F is reached, record time.
g) Continue until test chamber no long increases in temperature, record time and temperature.
9) Once testing is done, remove the 5v signals and open the psi gauge to max and cool the system for
at least 45 min.

Arduino Automated System Testing (Max Temp and Heat-up Time)

The test is functionally equivalent to the preliminary testing instructions, except that the process has
been automated by the Arduino program.
Caution: Do not turn on power to the system until shop air is connected and flowing.
1) Complete the pre-power up checklist. Report any failures and cease operation if any failures found.
2) Don all protective gear (Gloves, Googles and Mask) .
3) Attach shop-air and 240v power inputs.
4) Start a small flow.
5) Turn the testing unit’s power switch to on.
6) Manually adjust shop air via PSI gauge near input to desired PSI.
7) Use an Arduino serial monitor to issue the serial command “RunTest [Main/Band/Both] <time>”,
where the second argument tells the system what heaters to use and <time> is an amount of time in
minutes. The Arduino will now turn on the heaters and poll both thermocouples every minute and
print the results to serial, formatted with the time.
a) Test for 15 minutes to determine if heat-up time is meet.
b) Test for an arbitrary amount of time until the test chamber is 1000°F.
c) Test for an arbitrary amount of time till the test chamber no longer raises in temperature.
8) Once testing is done, open the psi gauge to max and cool the system for at least 45 min.

Load the "Start-up Routine" as the first sequence.
Load or construct the desired test routine in the GUI.
Load the "Cool Down Routine" as the last sequence.
Remove the four clamps holding the test section in place. Two on the top and two on the bottom.
Separate the testing sections by sliding on the track.
WARNING: All exposed, non-insulated surfaces may be at extremely high temperatures.
Avoid all contact with exposed surfaces and always wear protective gear while changing
the test sample.
NOTE: There is a graphite gasket between each section. Take care to not lose or damage
these gaskets. Graphite sheets are brittle.

8) Place the test sample in the testing chamber, using the appropriate test bracket.
9) Slide the testing sections back together, taking care to ensure the graphite gaskets are placed
correctly, and clamp in place.
10) Initiate the test routine using the GUI.
11) Allow test routine to complete, ensuring there is an operator monitoring the system for faults.
