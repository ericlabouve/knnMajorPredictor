ABSTRACT
This project is the first iteration of a testing rig to determine the critical submergence of a
vortex off a main suction header. The rig was designed with supplies purchased and provided by
PG&E, including 4-6” schedule 40 PVC pipe and fittings, a large water tank, a pump, and a
flowmeter. PG&E at Diablo Canyon Power Plant presented their problem to the Cal Poly
Mechanical Engineering Senior Project class, and three mechanical engineers took up the project.
The following report details the ideation, design, build, and test processes used during the
2016-17 academic year to create the vortex testing rig. We determined through testing that the
location of hydraulic jump can be influenced by how open or closed the branch line valve was,
which in turn influenced when gas ingestion to the pump occurred.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 ABOUT THE PROJECT
This study of exploring vortexing off a common header is a senior project for the 2016-17
California Polytechnic State University of San Luis Obispo’s (Cal Poly SLO) Mechanical
Engineering department. This senior project is sponsored by PG&E, one of the largest electric
utility companies in California serving 5.2 million households. The project will be overseen by our
adviser, Professor Eileen Rossman, and our sponsor, Anderson Lin, who is a Principal Engineer at
Diablo Canyon Power Plant located in Avila Beach, California.
We will be working closely with Mr. Lin and a team of other employees at PG&E to design
a testing apparatus that will simulate the systems that are currently operating in the plant. This
occurrence does not happen in any particular part of the power plant system, but rather vortexing
is an event PG&E would like to accurately measure in order to report the safety or vulnerability of
the plant to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Currently, the NRC has a zero tolerance
policy regarding the intrusion of bubbles into any system throughout a power plant. But if there is
any form of maintenance in a system where the removal of components is necessary, then a small
volume of air is bound to linger within the system piping.
PG&E is sponsoring us to design a test rig and develop a nondimensional equation to
predict the depth of fluid at which a vortex begins to form to ingest air from a common suction
line into a branch line, also known as the critical submergence depth, S. This test rig will allow us
to visually observe the critical depth at which a vortex forms that will ingest air bubbles through
the branch lines, or offtake lines, leading to a pump. This gas ingestion could be damaging to the
pump or the overall system and can eventually compromise plant operation. A graphic shown in
Figure 1 illustrates that the air bubble is formed in the main suction line downstream of a fluid
tank, while the vortex will form downwards into the branch suction nozzle. Our main focus when
we conduct experiments is in the black box labeled ‘Control Volume’, but we will be designing

2
the entire system. Note that in Figure 1 the vortex occurs when the flowrate through the branch
line increases. Even though the submergence depth does not change, the system still becomes
critical. Thus the submergence depth is tied to some aspect of the flowrate. We will also like to
observe the effects of the vortex when the branch line coming off the main suction line is in either
the vertical, horizontal, or 45° position, always perpendicular to the main line.

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 MOTIVATION
Several of the piping systems in a nuclear plant have a large number of locations where gas
can be introduced to, or generated within, the lines. This gas could challenge plant operations if a
large enough bubble makes its way into a pump; the pump will lose suction and will not operate
as designed. Loss of a pump can degrade plant safety and cause a safe, but economically costly,
shutdown.
In 1988, Diablo Canyon Power Plant experienced loss of a pump during a routine refueling
of one of the reactors. Normal procedure for refueling a reactor requires that the level of water in
the reactor be reduced to mid-loop to drain the steam generators. To be reduced to mid-loop means
to decrease the maximum fluid level to only one half the diameter of the pipe. In order to keep the
core cool, a branch line is opened and cooling water is diverted from the reactor system into a
branch suction line to a heat exchanger. In the case of this incident, the branch line ingested enough
gas due to vortexing and lost the siphon in the pump suction high point to break the flow of water
to the pump, causing it to gas bind and fail. This resulted in the loss of core cooling, which led to
the emergency flooding of the nuclear vessel to cool the core. A configuration that may closely
represent this problematic area is shown in Figure 2. This event highlighted the importance of
studying how vortices form at junctions in piping systems. Because there are many different
locations where this phenomenon is important to model, we are interested in developing a
nondimensional equation that can be applied to a large range of flows and geometries.

lines[1].

2.2 BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Due to the difficulty of the governing equations for fluid dynamics, a majority of problems
cannot be solved with a direct analytical approach and instead rely on correlations developed from
experimental data. In order for the results of our experiment to be applicable to a wide range of
systems, we need to employ the concept of similitude. Our experimental rig will be able to scale
kinematic, geometric, and dynamic factors where possible in order to scale to larger systems.
The first step in nondimensional analysis is to determine which variables are of interest
and to represent these variables as a set of nondimensional numbers. A powerful method of
determining these nondimensional groups is called the Buckingham Pi theorem. The terms are
determined by first reducing each of the relevant variables into its basic dimensions of mass,
length, and time. The variables are then split into the dependent variable that is of interest (in our
case it is the critical submergence depth), repeating variables, and non-repeating variables. For
the first pi term, the dependent variable is kept in the denominator and three repeating variables
are each raised to a coefficient such that the basic dimensions cancel out. This process is repeated
for each remaining non-repeating variable. The process yields a set of fewer nondimensional
groups than the original number of variables of interest [2].
Once we calculate our nondimensional groups we can begin testing and collecting data. In
collecting data, we need to record data for all of our variables so we can explore a variety of
relationships between our nondimensional groups. We will form an equation from our collected
data by regression analysis. This is a statistical method to estimate the relationship between two
variables resulting in an equation. There are a number of different methods to use with the most
common being the ordinary least squares method.
Several studies have been done to determine a nondimensional relationship to predict the
critical submergence depth for a vortex that will form in a stagnant tank of water. The critical
submergence depth, S, is nondimensionalized by dividing it by the pipe’s diameter, D, both
illustrated in Figure 1. Many of experimental studies have found S/D to be a function of the Froude
number [3]. The Froude number characterizes the ratio of the inertial forces to the gravitational
forces in the fluid and is defined as
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 =

𝑉𝑉

�𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔

(1)

In Equation 1, V represents the characteristic flow velocity, g represents Earth’s
gravitational constant, and D represents the diameter of the pipe [2]. The Froude number is often
used when studying flow with a free surface.

5

2.3 HISTORY AND DEFINITION OF VORTICES
There has been much research done to determine the characteristics of vortices. Starting in
1858, Hermann von Helmholtz published a mathematical study of vortices, perhaps being the first
to investigate vortex motion and its properties. He was followed by William Thomson, better
known as Lord Kelvin, in 1869, who developed a theory of the material atom as a vortex ring [4].
Vortices usually describe the motion in a frictionless fluid. If there was no friction in fluids,
there would be no way to create or stop the motion of a vortex, although that is not the case in
reality because frictionless fluids do not exist. In order to overcome friction and continue the vortex
motion, one needs to apply a constant power supply to the fluid.
The vorticity of a vortex is the measure of the strength of rotation, which is defined as the
curl of the velocity vector of the fluid. The individual vectors are connected with what is called
a vortex line. As one begins to group up the vortex lines, you are left with a vortex tube, which is
what many people are familiar with when they see whirlpools or tornadoes.
[5]

The formation of a vortex is a simple concept. As a water molecule is pulled towards the
bottom of the tee it accelerates in a straight line, however, as the other molecules around it also try
to accelerate directly at the bottom of the tee, they interfere with one another and generate an
overall rotation in the flow. This effect compounds until the downdraft of the flow is enough to
drag air along with it, and a vortex is formed.

2.4 PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS
The experiment we will conduct is unique because the cross flow in the main suction line
will not be stagnant. Some differences between our experiment and experiments found online
include transient flow in the main suction line and the fact that the main suction line will not be
exposed to the atmosphere. The following cases are different to our scenario, but have some
research that will allow us to improve our study as will be described below.
2.4.1

Case 1
In 2014, a paper by Carlos Julián Gavilán Moreno [3] was published that studied the
accuracy of predicting critical submergence depth based on the Weber and Reynolds number.
Although this study showed that common calculations in determining critical submergence used
the Froude number, this study did not use it. We will be using Froude’s number in determining our
nondimensional equation, but this study provides an interesting alternative.
One way this paper quantified the depth for a vortex formation was based on certain types
of vortices. Both the paper and our sponsor recommended obtaining data for a Type 6 vortex, as
shown in Figure 3.

6

Figure 3. Types of vortices to determine critical submergence depth [3].

In Case 1, flow from a reservoir leading to a pipe with a nozzle is observed. First, he
calculated Fr for a range of values using Equation 2.
𝜌𝜌

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅∙ϑ

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊�𝜎𝜎𝜎𝜎 = 𝐿𝐿 2

(2)

�𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔

Then, he numerically modeled critical submergence using Finite Element Analysis. To
ensure his model was accurate, he compared the simulated submergence with experimentally
determined submergence, and for various flowrates he observed a total simulation error of less
than 5%. He plotted these two sets of data and used the non-linear least squared method in order
to obtain the coefficients for a corrected critical submergence; Equation 3 is the result,
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 2

𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐 = 𝑎𝑎 + 𝑏𝑏 �106 � + 𝑐𝑐 ∙ 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 + 𝑑𝑑 �106 � ∙ 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 + 𝑒𝑒 �106 � + 𝑓𝑓 ∙ 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 2

(3)

with a, b, c, d, e, and f are the coefficients obtained from the non-linear least squared method.
The take away from Case 1 is the use of obtained experimental data and plotting the data
in order to refine the anticipation of a particular phenomenon. In our case, this phenomenon is
critical submergence.
2.4.2

Case 2
Next, we examined a paper published by Yaser Sheikhi and Babak Lashkar-Ara, a student
and professor in Iran. By using four different models, a nondimensional equation was found using
nonlinear regression (as opposed to linear regression analysis) [6]. One way they found this
equation was by using a critical spherical sink surface (CSSS). The CSSS has the same center and
discharge as where the fluid enters from the reservoir into the pipe and the radius of the CSSS is
equal to the critical submergence for an intake. In order to determine the radius of the CSSS, the

7
total area minus the area that is blocked is accounted for. For a detailed account of the math, please
refer to the reference section [6]. This imaginary surface is then used as a way to determine critical
submergence and is employed as a means with experimental data to create a nondimensional
equation.
The most relevant knowledge this paper provided was about the Kolf number. The Kolf
number is a nondimensional parameter that depends on the geometry of the intake and whether or
not there is end circulation in the pipe. End circulation, Γ, is “the strength of the vortex tube” and
is defined by “the product of the vorticity normal to the surface enclosed by the curve C” [7], shown
in Figure 4; the equation to calculate end circulation is defined in Equation 4.
𝛤𝛤 = ∫ ɷ • 𝑛𝑛 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

(4)

Figure 4. Vectors showing end circulation components.
Inevitably, the authors of this paper disregarded the Kolf number since there was no
imposed end circulation. However, the Kolf number is considered here because it might affect our
data depending on how the test rig is designed. Although our testing rig down the line may share
similarities to their schematic shown in Figure 5, they fail to attempt this experiment with cross
flow in the main suction header and only use one branch line, whereas we will experiment with
cross flow and apply three different angled branch lines.

3 OBJECTIVES
3.1 STATEMENT
We will investigate the phenomenon that creates a vortex and attempt to relate specific
conditions of the piping system (pipe diameters, flowrates, etc.) to a correlation of the critical
submergence depth to the formation of a vortex. Once we build a test rig to conduct observations
and use various instruments to capture flow and fluid depth data, we will deliver our results to the
team at PG&E. Our intention is that they will be able to use our results to accurately predict when
a pump will fail due to the gas-binding of oxygen.

3.2 SPECIFICATIONS
In order to create a test rig, we utilized a process called Quality Function Deployment
House of Quality (QFD), shown in Appendix A, in order to obtain realistic targets for our design.
The QFD is a tool that considers the following: customer requirements and needs, technical
research, and benchmarking. The main objective is to focus on what is needed for a project rather
than how to achieve it. We took the requirements presented to us by PG&E to find what needs
were most important to the design of the test rig. We then attempted to benchmark their needs to
similar test apparatus found online. Based on these inputs, the QFD helped us find a list of
engineering specifications and their associated targets. Since one specification can be dependent
on another, the top of the QFD shows the positive or negative relationship they have on one
another. By determining the relative importance of a specification to a requirement, we were able
to determine the relative weight of each customer requirement. From utilizing the QFD process,
we obtained the specifications found in Table 1. We assigned a High (H), Medium (M) or Low (L)
risk to each specification. Then we listed how we will verify each specification with different
methods: Analysis (A), Test (T), Similarity to Existing Designs (S), or Inspection (I).

For our first specification, we chose to focus on the overall size of our test rig. Because we
are given a shipping container at Pismo Yard for transportation of the project, we decided to
provide a maximum size relative to the dimensions of the shipping container. We do not expect
our project to reach that upper limit, but do not know at this time.
Also, we were asked to investigate how the critical submergence depth changes as the angle
of the branch coming off the main suction pipe changes. This is why we would like to conduct the
experiment using various branch suction nozzles positioned at angles of 0°, 45°, and 90°. These
multiple angles are shown in Figure 6 that are positioned radially from and perpendicular to the
main suction line.

Figure 6. Section view of multiple offtake branch angles at 0, 45, and 90°.
Accuracy is a high risk parameter because it would be desirable to obtain test results that
are repeatable as well as accurate in order to predict when a vortex would occur. PG&E would like
to use our rig and procedure to train employees in the future, so this requirement is a necessity.
In order to determine when a vortex will occur, we decided to choose a transparent pipe to
visually see the effect of changing water height and fluid flowrate. Thus the color of the pipe is an
important requirement in the determination of a vortex.
PG&E asked us to investigate the formation of vortices using multiple pipe dimensions
such as 4” to 6” diameter pipe for the main suction and branch offtake lines as to get data based
on varying parameters. Therefore, we chose to make our design modular in order to swap out
sections rather than to build a new piping system for each diameter we would want to test.
Applying this specification to the rest of the rig will also aid transportation from location to
location and assist in easy repairs if the need arises.
For certain flowmeters, it is necessary to develop fully developed flow throughout the
piping system. This is because we need to know what the flow profile looks like. Therefore, we

10
need to create fully developed turbulent flow. We will perhaps do this by installing flow guide
vanes in the 90° elbows or honeycomb plates for the straight run lines.
In the power plant, the main suction header and branch offtake lines experience different
flowrates in the system. But since our project is a scaled down version of the power plant system,
in theory and in conjunction with data obtained using dimensionless numbers, we have determined
we will be working with a range of flowrates from 500 – 1500 gpm. More analysis will be made
to determine a more exact range of flowrates our pump will provide during operation.
Our last specification is the range of Froude numbers we expect to be working with. From
research online, we determined to be working with Fr numbers in the range of 0-3. This will
provide us with a good starting point on what we should be expecting to see during the testing
phase.
Something else to consider is the budget for the overall test rig. We were not given an
estimate on the budget for the project, so we projected a rough cost of $10,000. We do not expect
to reach this number, but thought it was appropriate for a worst case scenario amount. By doing
an initial budget calculation of the parts needed for the rig, we expect to spend roughly $1,500,
without factoring in the cost of renting a pump since we do not know how long we would need to
rent it for.
The system within the power plant uses a boric acid-water solution, specifically 2500 parts
per million boric acid. This concentration is very small; therefore, we will be conducting the
experiment with water. Other vortex tests in the industry also use water rather than boric acid for
the simulation, so therefore we would be able to adequately compare our results later on to others
experiments. To ensure that this substitution is valid, EES calculations are produced in Appendix
B, showing that the density of the two fluids have a negligible percent difference and behave quite
similarly. If we have time in our design process, we would like to determine the similarities of
other fluid properties, such as viscosity and surface tension, since these are parameters that govern
the behavior of the air bubble.

4 DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
Once presented with this project, we began by defining the problem faced by PG&E. In
order to do that, we spoke with the PG&E team overseeing this project and asked questions about
what already exists and what is lacking in those systems. There have been no other tests done to
simulate the conditions provided by our sponsor. We proceeded to research similar papers and
experiments that involved inspecting the effects of a vortex in a similar system to ours, all of which
was covered in Section 2, Background.

11

4.1 CONCEPT GENERATION
We created a Quality Function Deployment House of Quality, shown in Appendix A, by
using the requirements from PG&E and the engineering specifications, which are shown in Table
1, we came up with for our test rig design, along with benchmarking previous tests from other
research groups. This allowed us to evaluate the parameters we used to come up with possible
designs of our test rig.
Next, we brainstormed different ways we could meet all the parameters described above in
section 3.2, focusing on one specific function at a time. Some individual functions we identified
were the following: measuring the water depth in the main line, changing the offtake angle, and
measuring the flowrate in the main and branch lines. To help us generate methods of achieving
these functions, we went to the local hardware store and explored the parts available for building
small piping systems. We looked at ways to join pipes, regulate flow, make removable
connections, change pipe diameter, and connect hose to pipe. We then held a brain writing session
to generate the following methods of performing the aforementioned functions.
4.1.1

Measuring Water Depth
The first method developed to achieve the measurement of water depth function was to
etch markings along the side of the tube that correspond to the depth of water at the center of the
tube, essentially creating a ruler directly measuring the depth in inches. We decided to use this
method as our datum to compare all our further ideas with so we could rank the methods against
one another. The rest of our ideas for this function include:
•
•
•
•

Marked U-Tube
Water Level Marked on a Weighted String
Floating Transducer Inside Pipe
Camera Setup w/ Height Marks on Backboard

Figure 7 shows a few of these solutions. In Figure 7 (a), we illustrate the U-Tube device
marked with incremental measurements on the side to determine the water depth. Since this system
is under pressure, we cannot have the U-Tube open to atmosphere. Therefore, the design would
require a connection at the top of the tube back to the main suction line, where the air pressure
would be the same. In Figure 7 (b), we show a transducer floating on the surface of the water inside
the pipe, sending out a signal to determine the depth of the water.

4.1.2

Changing the Offtake Angle

Our sponsor suggested to us to use flanged connections in order to change the offtake angle
during one of our preliminary meetings. This gave us the idea to put eight bolt flanges, shown in
Figure 8 (a), on either side of the main and branch line intersection to rotate the offtake angle of
the branch line. The flange needs to have eight bolts because it ensures angle between each bolt is
45°. We used this idea as our baseline datum, while the other ideas we formulated for this function
include:
•
•
•

Threaded Union
Rubber Tube w/ Hose Clamps
Flexible Tubing

Figure 8 (b) shows the use of flexible piping on either side of the intersection. This would
make it possible to rotate the pipe without having to drain the system, but would require a
significant force to hold in place at the three desired angles.

4.1.3

Measuring the Flowrate in the Main and Branch Lines
Another function we looked at was determining how to measure the flowrate in a pipe line.
The most common idea that we have had experience with in college is the pitot-static tube. We
used this as our datum but came up with a few other alternatives to solve this particular function:
•
•
•
•

Rotameter Attachment
Ultrasonic Flowmeter
Turbine Flowmeter
Nutating Disk Flowmeter

Figure 9 (a) illustrates the use of a pitot-static tube inserted into the main suction line to
determine the flowrate using the velocity of the fluid. A pitot-static tube determines the flow
velocity by measuring the difference between the flow’s static and dynamic pressure. The flow
velocity is generally measured at the center of the pipe where the flow is moving fastest.
Furthermore, determining the flowrate in a tube from its centerline velocity requires knowing the
velocity profile in the pipe. This velocity profile can vary wildly such that accurate analysis can
only be performed after the flow has had time to settle into a constant shape. Figure 9 (b) shows a
paddlewheel meter attached to the pipe as a pipe fitting. Paddlewheel flow meters work by using
a small rotating wheel to measure the velocity of the flow near the edge of the pipe.

4.1.4

Creating Flow Through Piping System
Next, we wanted to look into how we were going to create the fluid flow throughout the
piping system. To us, there was an obvious solution to this function, the pump. But we decided to
figure out if there were any other ways we could complete the same task differently. The solutions
to this function are as follows:
•
•
•

Pump
Gravity
Siphon

There are pros and cons to each of these options, all of which we will discuss in the next
section, Idea Selection.
4.1.5

Creating a Bubble Inside Main Line
The last function that we needed to brainstorm was a definitive way to create and insert an
air bubble within the main line of the system. We needed to insert either a stagnant slug of air
within the pipe and be able to gradually increase its’ size, or insert a constant flow of air, then
increase that flowrate to increase the bubble size. The solutions are as follows:
•
•
•
•

Air Compressor
Bike Pump
Open Channel to Atmosphere
Air Blower

4.2 IDEA SELECTION
To select the best ideas, our team set up Pugh matrices, shown in Appendix C. A Pugh
matrix is a scoring tool we used for concept selection where different options are scored relative
to a criterion, or datum. The selection is made based on the consolidated scores. For each of these
functions above, we used this tool to compare and evaluate a number of valid ideas based on the
specifications we created earlier. Some of these criteria include accuracy, ease of installation,
availability, overall dimensions, and cost. We felt that these and a few other criteria were essential

15
to look into. Once we assigned scores to each option based on the specifications and weighed the
individual specifications according to what we thought to be most important to the project, we
came up with the best option.
4.2.1

Evaluating Water Depth Measuring Devices

4.2.1.1 Directly Marking the Tube - Datum
Etching markings for water depth directly on the tube would be very low cost, but would
lose some accuracy when we mark the tube ourselves, rather than using a calibrated piece of
equipment. The device is incredibly non-complex and easy to install because it only requires
something to mark the tube. The markings on the tube would require almost no maintenance. The
only upkeep is refreshing the markings if they ever begin to fade.
4.2.1.2 U-Tube Measuring
Using the U-Tube would be easier since the measurements are read off a vertical tube with
equally spaced markings, rather than having to make readings off the curved surface of the pipe.
It would also be more accurate because we can purchase a calibrated graduated cylinder for our
readings, rather than using lines we marked ourselves. However, the installation would be more
difficult than directly marking the tube.
4.2.1.3 Floating Transducer
We believe this may not work because the bulk of the device may disrupt the flow and it
may be difficult to keep the device centered in the pipe to determine the maximum water depth.
The cost, complexity, installation, and maintenance requirement would all be much greater than
the datum. This analysis led us away from using the transducer.
4.2.2

Evaluating Means of Changing the Offtake Angle

4.2.2.1 8 Bolt Flange - Datum
Eight bolt flanges are widely available in a variety of pipe sizes for relatively cheap and
when used with a gasket they are watertight. They are able to provide great accuracy in our angle
of rotation because their bolt pattern ensures that we turn the intersection exactly 45° for each trial.
However, performing this rotation requires us to drain this part of the system, unbolt the flanges,
rotate them by 45°, and then re-bolt them. This may prove to be a time consuming process that
will slow our testing.
4.2.2.2 Threaded Union
When compared to the 8 bolt flange, the threaded union is more expensive, and harder to
find for pipe sizes greater than 4 inches. As a positive, it is easier to adjust than the flange because
there is only one large thread to loosen, as opposed to 8 smaller bolts. We also believe that the
union is more leak-proof than the flange because of its integrated O-ring.
4.2.2.3 Flexible Tube
The flexible tubing is harder to adjust and less accurate than the 8 bolt flange. Furthermore,
this solution would require the use of a protractor to accurately measure the rotation of the branch

16
line. Lastly, we have not been able to find a product we could purchase that would fit our use
without heavy modification.
4.2.3

Evaluating Flowrate Measurement Solutions

4.2.3.1 Pitot-static tube – Datum
The pitot-static tube is a cheap and simple solution, but the tube must be pointed directly
in line with the flow to get accurate results. Unfortunately, this alignment is difficult and time
consuming. The pressure drop caused by the pitot-static tube is almost negligible and its
interruption to the flow is minimal.
4.2.3.2 Turbine Flowmeter
The turbine flowmeter costs more than the pitot-static tube. It produces a similar pressure
drop and is about as easy to use. This would give us an accurate reading but we found it challenging
to find a 6-inch pipe variant without a long backorder time. Although, we could use a 4-inch variant
of the flowmeter that is available.
4.2.3.3 Ultrasonic Flowmeter
The ultrasonic flowmeter has the advantage of being more accurate, easier to use, and more
available then the pitot static tube. However, these benefits come at a steep cost that may outweigh
the benefit more than the Pugh matrix shows.
4.2.4

Evaluating Means of Creating Flow

4.2.4.1 Pump – Datum
A pump is the most common and simplest way to create a constantly moving flow. It does
this through a pressure difference in the piping. There will be a sizable jump in price for this
solution, but it will be reliable and repeatable.
4.2.4.2 Gravity
Another way we could move flow is by using gravity to transport the water. We could create a
vertical piping system, but this may be very tall and take up a lot of space. A downside to this
solution is that we would have to keep adding or pumping water back up to the initial height,
which may complicate the design.
4.2.4.3 Siphon
We could also use a siphon to cause the water to flow from one elevation to another.
However, since the amount of water needed would decrease in a tank, the flowrate of the system
would change with time. Although it may be an easy option, we could only run the system for a
certain amount of time before the water runs out. It would require a pump to get water back up to
the starting point.

17
4.2.5

Evaluating Bubble Formation Solutions

4.2.5.1 Air Compressor – Datum
Although the air compressor may be an expensive alternative, we believe that it can supply
a constant flow of air. The rate at which it can inject air is much faster than the other options. The
pressure to overcome that of water and volumetric flow to push air down to half the diameter
(assuming critical submergence happens at or before this depth) is about 6 psi and 19 cfm as shown
in Appendix N. This calculation assumes a pump outputting 450 gpm, but since the pump we chose
will have about 420 gpm, the flow needed to introduce an air bubble will be less than 19 cfm. With
the aid of an air booster, we will be able to reach upwards of 50 cfm.
4.2.5.2 Bike Air Pump
The bike pump is a cheap option when it comes to inserting air into the system.
Unfortunately, this method does not allow us to provide a constant flow of air since the pump
would need to be recharged after one pump. In addition, knowing how much pressure is already
going to be within the system, it will be very hard to inject air if we cannot meet and exceed that
value.
4.2.5.3 Open Channel to Atmosphere
Rather than injecting air into the system, we thought we could leave the water at a constant
level within the main line. Air from the atmosphere that enters by the tank would fill in the rest of
the main line. If we change the flowrate, then the height of water, or critical submergence depth,
would change. The downside to this solution is that it can only work with low fluid flowrates; once
past this range, the pipe would fill up the whole cross section, pushing out the open channel of air
needed to find the critical submergence depth.
4.2.5.4 Air Blower
Another option besides using an air compressor is an air blower. Air blowers can output
high amounts of volumetric flow, but operate at low pressures. Unfortunately, since the pressure
at the location where we are going to inject air will be around 6 psi, using air blowers might not
be the best option to produce an air bubble.
4.2.6

Forming Concepts
To narrow down the number of combinations of concepts, we discussed some components
that would work well compared to their respective options. Two of the functions we narrowed
down were the means of which to create flow through the pipe and an air bubble in the main line.
Evaluating our options, we found that the best and most efficient way to create flow throughout
the system would be to use a pump that produces a pressure head and causes flow. This allows us
to get repeatable quick data, rather than resetting the system after each run (which is needed if we
chose the gravity or syphon concepts). Next, we figured that the best way to induce a bubble within
the main line of the system would be to make use of an air compressor. Again, this component
choice gives us the ability to get continuous and accurate data without having to reset the system
or rely on human labor to inject air, such as with the bike air pump. For the other functions, we
decided to determine which components worked best with each other as a whole. For the functions

18
from sections 4.2.1, 4.2.2, and 4.2.3, we used the top three ideas from each of our Pugh matrices
and inserted them into a morphological chart, which can be found in Appendix D. A morphological
chart is a tool that allows us to present all possible combinations of solutions so a team can quickly
visualize the options and select the top contenders.
The X-, Y-, and Z- axes of this three dimensional chart corresponds to a particular function,
and each space on these axes corresponds to a method of performing the function. Each space on
a particular axis will intersect every combination of the spaces on the other two axes. By examining
these combinations, we can see all the options for our concepts. When evaluating combinations,
Ryan chose the concept in Figure 10 (a) with 8-bolt flanges, the marked U-Tube, and pitot-static
tubes for pressure measurements resulting in a fluid flowrate. Brian chose the concept in Figure
10 (b) with threaded unions, a ruler projected directly on the pipe, and an ultrasonic flow meter.
Lastly, Brett chose the concept in Figure 10 (c) with threaded unions, the marked U-Tube, and a
paddlewheel flowmeter. After we each chose a unique concept that may satisfy the needs of the
customer the best, we used a final decision matrix, in Appendix E, to compare the concepts to each
other. This decision matrix acts much like the Pugh matrix mentioned in the start of section 4.2.
We used it to evaluate and prioritize all three concepts we came up with by establishing a list of
weighted criteria and proceeded to evaluate how well those options met those criteria. Those
criteria are very similar to the criteria used in the Pugh matrices, including cost, ease of use,
availability of parts, and accuracy. Once we added up the weighted scores, we produced our final
design.
The basis behind selecting certain scores for one concept evolved from the theory of
approaching the construction of the test rig in a cautious manner. We chose to go with flanges
instead of unions because flanges are more readily available for larger sizes. For measuring the
height of flow, we selected a U-Tube instead of a marked ruler on the pipe for accuracy purposes.
Lastly, for measuring flowrate, we chose to use a pitot-static tube, instead of either an ultrasonic
flowmeter or paddlewheel meter, mainly to keep the cost down.

selection, and (c) Brett’s concept selection.
4.2.7

Initial Concept
Our initial top design, shown in Figure 11, ended up using 8-bolt flanges, the U-Tube level
meter, and pitot-static tubes. We included offset 6” to 4” reducers to allow for our main line to be
either 4” or 6” if we had time to run additional tests at a larger main line diameter. Both our main
line and the tee to the branch line would have been made using clear PVC. This would have
allowed us to see the bubble size in the main line during the formation of a vortex at the
intersection. Due to the high cost of large clear pipe and clear fittings, these areas were the only
ones constructed with clear PVC. Common Schedule 40 PVC pipe would have made up the rest
of the system.

20

Figure 11. A basic Solidworks model of the proposed piping system. Clockwise from the top of
the tank on the far left we have: an 8 bolt flange (1), a 6”-4” reducer (2), a clear main line (3), a
clear tee (4), a 6”-4” reducer placed backwards (5), another flange (6), the air inlet (7), a
butterfly valve attached with flanges (8), our bottom tee (9), two more flanges (10), the pump
(11), and finally flanges connecting back to the tank (12). Note the flexible hose forming the
branch line between the two tees.
The hose connecting the top tee to the bottom tee would have been made using flexible
EVA plastic to allow the main line to rotate from 0° to 45 and 90° without having to replace the
branch line pipe. All unthreaded connections would have been glued together with primer and
PVC cement, and all threaded connections would have been tightened down with Teflon tape over
the threads to prevent leaks. The flanged connections would have a gasket in between the two
halves for leak prevention. The main line would have had an uninterrupted straight entrance length
of 14 feet between the tank and the control volume, shown in Figure 1, to allow the flow to become
fully developed. This allowed us to use a simple Pitot static tube to calculate the flow rate of the
water based off the measured centerline velocity. The pipe exiting the tank would have had a 6inch diameter pipe to allow us to run tests with a 4-inch main line, and a 6-inch main line if we
had time to run the tests. The U-shaped bubble trap shown at the tank outlet would trap air in the
main line as the system is initially filled with water and would be as compact as possible to
minimize head loss.
Figure 12 shows a close-up view of the clear tee where we planned to expect to see our
vortex, the 6” to 4” offset reducer, and the air compressor inlet. The offset reducer, by the 90degree elbow downstream of the control volume, along with the U-shaped bubble trap next to the
tank, created a higher elevation area where an air bubble would become trapped while initially
filling the system with water. This allowed us to have an initial bubble in the system that we could
later expand. We expected this initial bubble to amass in the upper elbow where the flow turns
from horizontal to flowing downwards and along the length of the pipe due to the U-shaped bubble
trap. This is because the friction between the bubble and water would try to pull the air along the
path of the water’s flow, but once the flow turns downward, the buoyancy of the air would have
forced the bubble upward until the force due to friction and the buoyancy force cancel out. Our
intuition tells us that the friction due to the water flowing past would not have been enough to
force our large bubble down the vertical pipe and away from the air inlet. The air inlet is positioned

21
near the elbow in order to take advantage of this and add air to our already formed bubble. This
would reduce the time it takes to set our system up by ensuring all the air we add to the system is
immediately part of our large bubble, rather than spray into the water and forming a multitude of
small bubbles that will require time to rise and meld together. However, since the initial size of
this air bubble might be too big, a bleed valve might have been necessary to release some air from
the main line into the atmosphere, thereby increasing the water depth and avoiding critical
submergence too early in the process.

Figure 12. A larger view of the Solidworks model focusing on the clear tee, backwards 6”- 4”
offset reducer, and air inlet.
Dimensions of components in the testing rig were determined based on the conditions for
smooth flow. The vertical height of the tube was estimated at 4 feet. We would have continued to
research previous projects and studies in order to estimate the total height required to contain the
bubble if we proceeded with this design. We researched flow-conditioning devices, such as tube
bundles and honeycomb straighteners, to obtain fully developed flow with less pipe, and positive
displacement meters for liquids that were large enough to fit on our pipe without requiring a
reducer. With this design in mind, we gave a presentation on our PDR to our sponsor and his team
at Diablo Canyon Power Plant.

22

4.3 ORIGINAL DESIGN CHANGES
With their feedback, we made some critical changes to our design. For the purposes of
describing what sections were areas of concern, Figure 13 shows the original design.

Figure 13. Initial design with areas of interest circled.
The first issue our sponsors mentioned is that based on this design, the pump would not
increase flow in the main line. This is because although altering the performance of the pump will
increase the flowrate of water into the tank, the only thing driving the flow from the tank into the
U-trap is the pressure of water above the inlet, and so altering the pump performance will not
increase flow into the main line.
The second issue we had was the possibility of cavitation at the inlet of the pump. Due to
major losses and lack of pressure, the head will be below the required net positive section head
(NPSHR) before the flow reaches the pump. Therefore, to avoid cavitation, the pump should have
been placed somewhere at the top on the main line.
One last concern was the influence of falling water on the air bubble. Because the water
will be turbulent, the air bubble may be dragged down at the downward elbow after the
intersection. We assumed a constant air bubble condition, but this disruption might affect our
bubble size upstream and could lead to inconclusive results.
The team at Diablo Canyon also suggested to use alternate components to the ones we
selected using our Pugh Matrices. They advocated for the use of unions to rotate the main line
because we would not have to drain the system of water and it would save a lot of time during the
testing phase of the project. The team also suggested to move away from the U-Tube water
measurement concept because there will be too much pressure within the pipes to use a rubber
tube. To make it easier, they referred us back to our datum idea of simply writing the water height
on the side of the main line to determine critical submergence. Since we have a large budget to
work with, they recommended substituting the Pitot-static flowrate measurement device with a
turbine flowmeter. This will allow us with more accurate flow data the ability to easily attach
anywhere within our system.

23

5 FINAL DESIGN
Based on the feedback from our sponsor, we made alterations to avoid for improper pump
placement, potential cavitation, and turbulent disturbances. Our new design is shown in Figure 14.

Butterfly
Valve

Turbine
Flowmeter

Pump
Figure 14. Assembly of the updated design (air compressor not shown).
In the new design, the pump acts to add pressure to the system that increases the flow of
water, and has a discharge connecting pipe to pipe (not pipe to tank). By positioning the pump
after the tank in the system, we found that we would avoid pump cavitation. The last major revision
we made is the pipe layout in relation to where air is injected into the main pipe. Before, due to
the pipe layout, after air was injected into the main line, it would proceed to travel vertically
downwards. This was adverse for several reasons. One reason is because it might have disrupted
the air bubble upstream of this vertically downward portion and would tamper with data on when
critical submergence would occur. Another reason is because the pump was located downstream
of the air bubble, with no way to the vent the bubble, so that there was a good chance air bubbles
would reach and harm the pump.
The tank in the new system will be open to atmosphere to allow the release of bubbles from
the system upstream of the pump. Instead of using flanges, we changed to unions as the component
to change the main-branch offtake angles, due to maximum pressure that the component can
withstand while serving the same purpose of pipe rotation. We also fixed the two diameters of the
main and branch line since having several diameters of the branch line proved too difficult to
design for. This is because we would have to drain the top half of the testing rig in order to swap
out different sized piping, which would take up a lot of time and water. Having the modularity of
various branch diameters can be a consideration to include in a second version of this system. Due
to the valve location near the inlet, there is a possibility that the valve might disrupt the steady
state growth of the air bubble. To account for this, we decided to use a length equivalent to 15

24
times the diameter of the pipe. This will be covered more in depth in Section 5 of Engineering
Validation & Analysis.

5.1 MATERIAL SELECTION
Much of the testing rig will comprise of opaque Schedule 40 PVC pipe, with the exception
of the main line pipe and intersecting tee junction. The main reason for this is to decrease spending
since the only area of interest is where the vortex will occur. As noted before the main line and
intersection will be made of a clear PVC material. The water tank in the system is made of a plastic
material that is readily available.
After drawing a system curve and comparing it to a pump curve, the Multiquip QP4TH
was chosen because it can handle a flowrate up to 550 GPM. This pump is also ideal because it
was provided to us for free by Quinn Cat Rentals (Appendix M). The pump inlet and outlet are
equipped with National Pipe Threads (NPT) so we will therefore be able to connect the pump
directly to PVC pipe using a flange and female adapter. Since the inlet and outlet diameters for the
pump is 4", a reducer will also need to be used since the PVC pipe joining to the pump will be 6"
in diameter.
Next, we will also need something to support the piping of the testing rig. To handle this
task, we are using metal scaffolding readily available at Pismo Yard, pictured in Figure 15. This
scaffolding is left over from a past senior project sponsored by PG&E.

Figure 15. Scaffolding at Pismo Yard to support test rig piping.

25

5.2 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
We must be cautious when manufacturing and constructing the rig itself. We will be
working with a few large, heavy pipes and machinery and must handle them with care. When
transferring or attaching pipes to the assembly, we will make sure to use both hands and have it
supported by at least two people at a time. Our team requires that no one person is working on the
project alone in case of serious injury and in need of immediate assistance.
In obtaining data for this experiment, the engineers operating the system should be cautious
and alert in order to avoid any injuries. Since this system contains long lengths of pipe, extra
attention will be paid to our surroundings for safety precautions as to not hit one’s head on an
elevated object or lean up against an unsteady part. Several failure effects considered in the FMEA
in Appendix I include an unstable structure harming individual or water spilling on electronics due
to pipe burst. Other safety considerations consist of electrical hazards from the generator or if air
somehow manages to reach the pump and damage it.
While the entire system is up and running, safety glasses and hearing protection will be
worn at all times for the pump and air compressor running the system. Close-toed shoes are a
requirement when working with or near the assembly due to the use of large objects. We will ask
our sponsor to provide us with hard hats as well for head protection. We also ask that our sponsor,
or a member of the PG&E team, attends the assembly and testing phases to provide us with
guidance and supervision at the testing site located at Pismo Yard.

5.3 MAINTENANCE & REPAIR CONSIDERATIONS
During the manufacturing of the acrylic block intersection part or the clear PVC main line,
a crack may form within the part. If this did occur, we ordered a backup part to ensure the least
amount of setback in our schedule. Once the testing rig was manufactured and built to completion,
there were inevitable maintenance issues that had to be faced to ensure the rig was working
correctly. If a water leak was found anywhere in the system, we shut down the process and repaired
the seal between the parts in question with either PVC glue or caulking. This mainly occurred at
the joint between the tank and the PVC fitting. All we could do was replace the silicon sealant to
mitigate any leakages. Another place where we experienced leaks was at most of the unions used
in the system. We found that it was very difficult to tighten these by hand, and there were no tools
large enough for this job at local hardware shops. Most likely long after our testing is over, the
waterproof seals, located at the inlet and outlet of the tank, will eventually degrade and need to be
replaced. We don’t believe that the degradation of the seals will cause a problem in the few months
that we are testing the rig.
The pipes throughout the system are supported by a scaffolding structure. Special care was
taken to ensure that over time, the scaffolding does not deflect to a significant degree under its
own weight. Based on the analysis shown in Appendix K, we are confident the piping will be
sufficiently supported, but this analysis is covered more in depth next in Section 5.4. If for some
reason during testing this was not the case and there was a clear sag in the pipe, we would have
halted testing and added another support at that location. This is relatively easy because the

26
scaffolding can be easily removed and transferred to another location using portable rod clamps
provided by PG&E.
Corrosion was not an issue because the main material we are using, PVC, has excellent
corrosive resistance. Although, if the metal scaffolding showed signs of rust from prolonged
exposure to rain, we would have used steel wool or other corrosion removal methods to clear the
metal from rust.

5.4 ENGINEERING VALIDATION & ANALYSIS
5.4.1

Simulating a Boric Acid Solution
We found that the addition of boric acid to water at 2500 parts per million causes a
negligible change in density when compared to pure water. We calculated this by specifying a ratio
of 2500 moles of boric acid to 1 million moles of water. The densities of the separate substances
were used to determine the volume of the previously mentioned molar amounts and the molar
masses of both water and boric acid were used to determine the mass of each. The volumes and
masses of both were added and divided out to find the total density. From this calculation, the
difference in the density was so small it fell outside the range of the significant figures we chose
to use. Therefore, we are using water for this experiment. The Engineering Equation Solver file
used to do this calculation is included in Appendix B.
5.4.2

Determining Flowrate Ratio
When water is flowing through a system with parallel branches, the water will take the path
of least resistance until the flowrate through that path is large enough to equalize its resistance
with the other paths. Major losses in pipes refers to the losses due to friction with the material and
diameter pipe walls. Pipes with smaller diameters have greater major losses than larger pipes at
the same flow rate. Because we are interested in testing the effects of branch lines with smaller
diameters than the main line, more water will flow along the main line than the branch line. To
determine the different ratios of flow rates achievable with our system, we explored the ratio in
flowrates between the branch line and the main line at our maximum flow rate of 1000 gallons per
minute. We used the circuit analogy to simplify the piping system as shown in Figure 16.

Figure 16. Circuit analogy for the piping system.

27
Here, flow rate Q is analogous to current, pressure head h to voltage, and loss coefficient
KL to resistance. Note that in fluid systems at a given loss head loss is proportional to the square
of the flow rate whereas in electrical systems the voltage drop is directly proportional to the current
[2]
. This gives us Equation 5.
ℎ = 𝐾𝐾𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑄𝑄 2

(5)

The major losses in a pipe on a flow rate basis are given by Equation 6,
𝑙𝑙

4

𝐾𝐾𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝑓𝑓 2𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 (𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷2 )2

(6)

where f is the Darcy Friction Factor, l is the length of the pipe, D is the diameter of the pipe, and
g is the gravitational constant. The Darcy friction factor is a nondimensional function of the flow’s
Reynolds number and the equivalent roughness, ε/D [2]. For smooth plastic pipe, ε is assumed to
be zero [2]. The Moody chart, Figure 8.20 in Reference 1, gives us f = 0.014 for our flow in 4 inch
pipe at an assumed 750 gpm *. The controllable source of losses in our system is the variable minor
loss coefficient for the butterfly valve, KL,valve. Minor losses occur at obstructions to the regular
flow of the water such as valves, bends, and tees. Each device has its own minor loss coefficient,
KL, as shown in Table 2.
The minor loss in a pipe per unit flow rate is given by Equation 7.

𝐾𝐾𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝐾𝐾𝐿𝐿 2𝑔𝑔 (𝜋𝜋𝐷𝐷2 )2

(7)

The branch and the main line outlet both start from the upper tee, Point 1 in Figure 16, and
meet up again at the bottom tee, Point 2 in Figure 16. Each of these points have the same change
in pressure head, h12. This allows us to equate the ratio between the main line outlet flowrate and
the branch line flowrate as a ratio of the square roots of their loss factors. This yields Equation 8.
𝑄𝑄𝑏𝑏
𝑄𝑄𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜

�𝐾𝐾

= �𝐾𝐾4

(8)

By varying the minor loss coefficient of the valve, we are able to vary the ratio of flow
rates from 0.25 when the valve is entirely open, all the way to infinity, when the valve is closed
all the way. A list of these valve losses are found in Table 2. These varying flow rates will give us
a wide enough range of Frout/Frb to get a useful relationship, where Frout is the Froude number for
the main line outlet and Frb is the Froude number in the branch line. The EES file showing these
calculations is in Appendix F.

*

Note that the Reynolds number, and thus the friction factor, changes with flow rate, so the friction factor should be recalculated
each time the flow rate changes. However, this calculation is being used as an estimation and the difference between a friction
factor of 0.014 and 0.0125 does not significantly change the results.

28

5.4.3

Determining Bubble Stability
Since the bubble in the system will extend along the length of the main line, the bubble can
break up by either the velocity gradient of the flow throughout the pipe, or due to turbulent flow
when the path of the fully developed flow is disturbed. Although there exist equations to determine
whether a bubble will be stable or unstable, these equations still are not reliable, and bubble
instability might happen earlier than expected or vary with constant parameters for multiple test
runs. However, the equations that exist will be a starting point [8]. We will likely determine bubble
stability empirically.

29
5.4.3.1 Breakup Due to Velocity Gradient
The velocity gradient along the fully developed flow may be enough to drag the bubble
throughout the rest of the system. Equation 9 is used to estimate the initial bubble radius when the
bubble starts to become unstable,

𝑁𝑁 =

𝑎𝑎𝑜𝑜 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺
𝜎𝜎

(9)

where N is a nondimensional velocity gradient, ao is in the initial size of bubble, G is the shear
rate, μ is viscosity of the water, and σ is surface tension. Equation 10 can then be used to determine
Ncrit in order to find the initial bubble size at the transition from stable to unstable.

𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 = 2 �1+19𝜅𝜅/16�

(10)

κ is experimentally determined, where when k>3 no breakup occurs and becomes elongated along
the flow direction [8].
5.4.3.2 Breakup Due to Turbulent Flow
Another way to characterize bubble stability is by examining how it behaves in turbulent
flow. Equation 11[8] is used to determine the diameter of an equivalent volume sphere is,
𝜏𝜏 > �𝜎𝜎 + 𝜇𝜇𝑝𝑝 �𝜏𝜏/𝜌𝜌𝑝𝑝 � /𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑒

(11)

where τ is the local shear stress, μp is viscosity of bubble, ρp is density of air, and de is the diameter
of an equivalent volume sphere.
5.4.4

Entrance Length Analysis
To ensure that we are taking water height measurements at the intersection correctly and
without error, we need to make sure the fluid is fully developed in the turbulent phase. To confirm
this condition, we performed calculations on the entrance length needed prior to the vortex location
at the intersection. From this analysis shown in Appendix L, we found that there must be
approximately 14 ft of pipe upstream of the tee-junction. Although, once this entrance length
exceeds the equivalent of 10 diameters of the pipe, one can use this distance. Therefore, since our
pipe is 6 inches in diameter, we must have an entrance length of at least 5 ft. To account for any
error in that approximation, we provided an extra 1’8” to our entrance length, resulting in a total
of 6’8” long, or equivalent to about 13 diameters of pipe.
5.4.5

Pump Selection Analysis
In the same manner that the flowrate ratio was found, an Engineering Equation Solver
(Appendix M) program was created using the circuit analogy for pipe flow. The program
simultaneously solved for the pressure at each point indicated in Figure 17, the flow rate of each
pipe section, the Reynolds and Froude numbers for each pipe section, and the required pump head
for a given return line flow rate and a flow coefficient for the butterfly valve, Cv. The program
populated a table that found these values at return line flowrates from 0.1 ft3/s (44.9 gpm) to 2 ft3/s

30
(897.6 gpm) and flow coefficients corresponding to a 6-inch butterfly valve at 10° intervals from
90° (fully open) to 10° (almost all the way closed).

Figure 17. Labeled view of the piping system showing what each of the variables in the EES
system curve code corresponds to.
We were interested in how closing the butterfly valve would affect the ratio between the
Froude number of the main line flow and the Froude number of the branch line flow. We plotted
this ratio versus the flowrate for each of the valve positions in Figure 18. From this graph, one can
see that valve actuation has less and less of an effect on the Froude ratio as the flowrate increases.
We decided that reaching flowrates farther above 1 ft3/s did not give us enough variation in the
Froude ratio to justify the cost of the large pump the flowrates would require.

Flowrate [cubic feet per sec]

Figure 18. The results of the EES system curve code showing how the ratio of Froude numbers
changes with flowrate and butterfly valve angle.
The system’s resistance will increase when the butterfly valve closes, and thus require a
larger pump head. We then plotted the flowrate versus the required pump head curve, show in
Figure 19 when the butterfly valve is open only 10° in order to find the required pump head
pressure at our desired flowrate of around 1 ft3/s, or 448.8 GPM.
From the graph shown in Figure 19, we can see that required pump head at a flowrate of
448.8 GPM is only 20 feet or about 8.7 psi. Because we are looking at a high flowrate at a relatively
low pressure, we decided to look for pumps that were designed for use in such conditions.
Additionally, the site where testing will occur is on the edge of the grid and cannot supply enough
current to power a large pump. This led us to explore agricultural irrigation pumps, trash pumps,
and other gasoline or diesel powered pumps that were designed to be non-permanent and pump a
large amount of water over a small vertical distance.

Flowrate [gpm]
Figure 19. System curve showing the required pump head to obtain a desired flowrate with a
main line diameter of 6 inches and a 4-inch diameter branch line with the butterfly valve 10°
open.
We selected the DuroMax XP904WP gas powered trash pump. We opted for this model
because it provides a higher maximum flowrate and a lower maximum pressure than similarly
priced competitors. It has a maximum flowrate of only 427 GPM (0.95 ft3/s) but any pump capable
of a higher flowrate would cost over $1000 more than the DuroMax. However, we cannot find a
published pump curve for it. The pump is not often used in a closed system like we have, but rather
in trash clearing applications where it is not essential to accurately predict pump performance.
Our initial design had the pump placed in a location that would cause the pump inlet to
experience less than atmospheric pressure. This puts the pump in danger of experiencing such a
low water pressure in the wake of the impeller blades that the water begins to cavitate and the
pump stalls. In order to ensure that this will not happen with this design we decided to look at the
pressure at the pump inlet (point 4 in Figure 17). We found that at our worst-case scenario, when
the pump is at its maximum flowrate of 427 GPM, the pressure at the inlet is 1.8 feet of head above
atmospheric pressure. Because the pump is experiencing greater than atmospheric pressure at the
inlet we are confident that there is no danger of pump cavitation.
5.4.6

Scaffolding Analysis
Another aspect of design to consider is the scaffolding. Due to the lengths and diameters
of pipe used, struts will be needed so that no sag appears. ASME has standards available to
determine strut locations for the span of a pipe section, but the standards assume a low bending
stress of 15.9 MPa [9]. In order to determine a safe enough length based on a more conservative
method, Equations 12[9] and 13[9] are used:

33
𝑆𝑆𝑏𝑏 =

�0.0624𝑤𝑤𝐿𝐿2 +0.1248𝑤𝑤𝑐𝑐 𝐿𝐿�𝐷𝐷

𝑦𝑦 =

𝐼𝐼

5𝑤𝑤𝐿𝐿4 +8𝑤𝑤𝑐𝑐 𝐿𝐿3
384𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸

(12)
(13)

where
𝑆𝑆𝑏𝑏 = Maximum bending stress (N/m2)
w = uniformly distributed weight of pipeline (N/m)
L = Span length (m)
wc = Concentrated weight on pipe line, e.g., flanges, valves, other significant point loads (N)
D = Outsider diameter of pipe (m)
I = Moment of Inertia of pipe (m4)
y = Maximum deflection (m)
E = Young’s modulus (N/m2)
To start the analysis, the longest length of pipe was considered since it would set a standard
for the lengths of the other sections of pipe. Therefore, the length of pipe considered is the
horizontal distance of the main traveling from the inlet of the tank to the end where the pipe
connects to an elbow. An initial calculation was done to determine the span length of sag using an
assumed factor of safety of 10. The result gave a span length of 3.2 m. For a pipe filled with water,
ASME standard B31.3 results in a less conservative span length of 5.2 m, but this considers only
the deadweight of the pipe and not any concentrated loads (such as flanges or valves); which means
that we will be designing our scaffolding such that our design should not overload the support in
a way that is more cautious than accepted engineering standards. Further analysis was done to
determine the maximum deflection at a length of 3.2 m and was found to be 8 mm. Since this
relatively is a high deflection for the purpose of constructing a 25’ pipe section, a table was created
at smaller lengths of 3.2 m, as shown in Table 3.

We decided to pick a length between struts of 1.0 m because we wanted to be conservative
in anticipating the loading of the pipes and components on the scaffolding. This would mean that
for a length of 25 ft (7.6 m), there would be approximately eight struts for support. PG&E has
scaffolding available at their yard in Pismo Beach, so we will be able to save money on purchasing
scaffolding materials. Comparing the amount of pipe support for a past experiment that PG&E
accomplished, we feel comfortable that the scaffolding will support the weight of our piping
system.
5.4.7

Air Compressor Analysis
In determining the power needs of a desirable air compressor to produce a slug of air, we
created a rudimentary calculation in EES; the purpose of this calculation was to determine the
cubic feet per minute (CFM) necessary in order to match the flowrate of water when the pipe is
initially full. A flow of 18.19 CFM was determined to be necessary for the above assumption as
shown in Appendix N. To compare this flow with the flows provided by air compressors at a
pressure, a calculation was done to convert 18.19 cfm to standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM)
using Equation 14. Using a Pactual value of (6 psi +14.7 psi) and an assumed Tactual value of 70°F
or 529.67°R Equation 14 gave 25.53 SCFM.

Looking at air compressors, we decided to select the Makita 10 Gal. Twin Stack Air
Compressor. This air compressor operates at 84 dBA, provides 14.0 SCFM @ 40 PSI, and is
powered by gas. Since any noise level above 85 dBA can result in permanent hearing damage, ear

35
protection may potentially be necessary, but because we will not be exposed to this sound intensity
for several hours continuously, we won’t make noise protection equipment mandatory.
Finding an air compressor that could provide the required amount of flow of 25.53 SCFM
seemed not feasible. The Makita Air Compressor we selected does not provide this amount;
therefore, before we officially purchase the Makita, we plan on testing out a length of pipe—with
water passing through—using a cheaper and smaller air compressor in order to see if our
calculations are guiding us in the right direction.

6 PRODUCT REALIZATION
Manufacturing of the test rig consists mainly of assembling purchased parts. However,
some parts need to be manufactured and the large size of the pieces means that the manufacturing
requires special consideration. Furthermore, to make the project as safe as possible, we will be
doing all manufacturing and gluing at the Cal Poly machine shops under supervision of the shop
technicians.

6.1 PURCHASING & ORDERING PARTS
Our group started off by submitting our bill of materials (BOM) to our sponsor. From there,
PG&E made the initial purchases based on what we specified for the project. Because there was a
little shortsightedness within our group, we found that there were parts missing from our original
bill of materials that we required. There was also a large delay in the time we submitted our BOM
to the time we received the shipments, ranging from a few weeks to two months until parts arrived.
We purchased the rest of the parts ourselves from the local hardware store and agricultural supply
store. Our sponsor reimbursed these orders once we provided him with the complete receipts.
These purchases can be found in the cost analysis in Appendix Q: Cost Analysis w/ List of Vendors
& Pricing (Incl. Tax & Shipping).

6.2 SCAFFOLDING ASSEMBLY
We got the scaffolding from PG&E’s property in Pismo Beach where it had been used for
a previous project that had been completed. We replicated this configuration when assembling the
scaffolding at Cal Poly for our project. Before disassembling, we took pictures to have something
to match the assembly on the Cal Poly campus. Once the metal rods and joints were transported
via trucks, we used wrenches to attach the rods together using the joints. Once the scaffolding
assembly was finished, we could begin building the testing rig on top of and around the scaffolding.

6.3 MANUFACTURING VARIOUS LENGTH PIPES (DRAWING NOS. PIPE6IN-XX
AND PIPE4IN-XX)
The project required many lengths of PVC pipe to be cut. These cuts did not need to be
very precise because there is a fair amount of room in the fittings to accommodate differences from
the specified length. These cuts were made with a large hand saw, as shown in Figure 20, which

36
was regularly used for the 4” and 6” sized pipes. These drawings are included within Appendix P:
Detail Part Drawing.

Figure 20. Brett using a hand saw to cut a PVC pipe section.

6.4 MANUFACTURING TEST SECTION ASSEMBLY (DRAWING NO. A2)
The piece that attaches to the test section and creates the tee-junction for our branch line to
attach (Drawing NO. TS-2 in Appendix P: Detail Part Drawing) is machined from a 6” by 6” by
4” block of acrylic. Acrylic is a difficult material to machine, and the large size of the part means
that it is more prone to cracking. Therefore, we elected to have the part machined with a CNC mill
by a Cal Poly machine shop technician, Tobias Shirts. This part is shown in Figure 21. Because
the blocks were not exactly the 6” by 6” by 4” blocks we thought they’d be, the first time a block
was machined, the counterbore was off centered. We elected to redo the machining with the second
block we ordered after changing the datum from an outside corner to the center of the part. This
change allowed us to machine a perfectly centered counterbore with high tolerances.

Figure 21. Manufactured acrylic block.

37
The clear length of the main line that makes up the majority of our test section (Drawing
NO. TS-1 in Appendix P: Detail Part Drawing) is size 6 schedule 40 clear PVC pipe. We used a
hand drill tool and a combination of a center drill and a hole saw to create the 4.03” diameter hole
in the side of the pipe. We opted for a slow cutting speed to avoid cracking the pipe. This
manufacutring process is shown in Figure 22.
We attempted to join the two parts with Weld-On® 4SC™ which was order by accident
instead of the correct Weld-On® 40™. Weld-On® 40™ is an adhesive designed to join acrylic to
polyester, butyrate, polycarbonate, PVC and other materials whereas Weld-On® 4SC™ is only
designed to join acrylic to acrylic. The Technical and Material Safety Data Sheet for this product
appear in Appendix R. After letting the Weld-On® 4SC™ dry, we found that the glue did not
adhere the two pieces and realized the error in ordering. We then opted to use clear PVC primer
and cement, which worked well and bonded the acrylic block to the clear PVC pipe. To add extra
leak security of the two parts, we applied a bead of silicon sealant around the joint.

Figure 22. Brett drilling a center hole while Brian holds
the pipe steady.

6.5 MANUFACTURING MODIFIED TANK (DRAWING NO. M1-TANK)
We were given a tank 4 feet in diameter by PG&E that had been used for a previous project.
However, this tank did not have the holes that our project required to connect the pipes. We
modified the tank by measuring the locations of the holes’ centers with a tape measure. We ensured
that the 6” hole on the bottom of the tank was directly opposite the other two holes by measuring
the tank’s circumference and dividing it by two. After we located the holes, we measured out the
real outer diameter of the pipe, 6.625” for size 6 pipe, or 4.500” for size 4 pipe, and drew the
required hole size onto the tank with a sharpie. A 4” hole saw with a center drill removed the
majority of the material within each of the marked circles. We used a reciprocating saw to carefully
remove additional material until the thickness of the line was the sole remainder of material that
needed to be removed. This last bit of material was ground off with a curved file by hand until
each of the pipes fit in their respective holes.

38

6.6 MANUFACTURING ORIFICE PLATE
Initially, we wanted to have a flowmeter in the branch line to be able to measure the flow
rate. After proposing this idea to engineers at PG&E, we decided to opt for an orifice plate instead,
saving them money and exposing us to alternate methods of measuring flow.
To determine the flowrate through the 4” offtake branch, we needed to create and install an orifice
plate. This orifice consisted of 1x1 foot 16-gauge steel plate. During manufacturing, we drilled
eight 3/4” clearance holes for 5/8” bolts in a circular orientation to pair with 4” flanges on either
side. This process of the manufacturing is displayed in Figure 23.
The 3” center hole was drilled out with a hole saw of appropriate size as shown in Figure
24. The hole saw was cooled and lubricated with cutting oil. We then cut and ground down the
edges to create a more circular plate.

Figure 23. Brian drilling holes into a steel plate to form the orifice plate.

Figure 24. A hole saw was used to drill the
main section of the orifice.

39

6.7 ASSEMBLING THE COMPRESSED AIR HOSE LINE
After our Critical Design Review with our sponsors at Diablo Canyon, we decided to
completely assemble on Cal Poly’s campus. This opened up the possibility to use the machine
shop’s compressed air to insert air into our test rig piping. After scrapping the air compressor idea,
we considered how we were going to design and manufacture the air hose line. The compressed
air line was mostly assembled of purchased pieces that were threaded together with Teflon tape.
One part that we needed to include in the hose assembly was a control valve. However,
because the flow control valve had a push-to-connect fitting for 3/8” OD tube, we needed to cut
down a piece of ¼” copper tubing, which has a 3/8” OD, and solder it into a copper ¼” tube to ¼”
NPT adapter.

Figure 25. Brett installing the air flow control valve on the air
line with wrenches to compress the Teflon tape.

6.8 CREATING WATER LEVEL MEASUREMENT DEVICE
In order to measure the water level depth at the intersection of the main line, we created a
transparent ruler to be taped onto the pipe. We used the Matlab software to create increments of
1/8" starting from the bottom center of the main line to the top center of the main line to create a
ruler that would represent the vertical height when taped onto a curved surface. For more
information, refer to Appendix T: Ruler Matlab Code.
Next, a SolidWorks drawing was created for the ruler. The lines of the ruler were
dimensioned per the vertical equivalent of a curved height, then renamed so that the distance of
the line on the ruler was spaced accurately. But the number given to each increment corresponded
only to the vertical height of any point on a curved surface. This is because we are only interested
in this height when recording when a vortex occurs. Because we are not interested with
measurements regarding the outer diameter of the main pipe, we accounted for the thickness of the

40
main line and started the ruler at the bottom part of the inner diameter and ended the ruler at the
top part of the inner diameter.
After the ruler was created and labeled with proper inch increments, we used the printing
service from the Cal Poly Print & Copy shop to print the ruler on an 8.5” by 11" transparent page.
This assembly is shown in Figure 26.

Figure 26. Transparent ruler taped to the main line.

6.9 ASSEMBLING WIRING
Wiring made up a large part of the electronics that had to be connected for the project to
work. First, the Omega FTB740 turbine flowmeter (Appendix U: Omega FTB740 Turbine
Flowmeter Spec Sheet) was connected to an Omega DPF701 display (Appendix V: Omega
DPF701 Display Meter), the same way it was given to us by PG&E. We also needed to connect a
pressure transducer for the orifice plate to the same display to read a voltage corresponding to a
differential pressure. To feed both connections into the same display, we had to wire in a double
pole double throw (DPDT) on/on switch onto the back of the display meter. Now once both devices
were connected properly to the display, we had to power them. The flowmeter already came with
a power cord, but the transducer did not. To power it, we installed a power converter to supply
24V DC power to the transducer.
However, the Omega display could only be used for totalizing rate inputs and would not
display the transducer reading as it was a steady voltage and not the oscillating frequency that the
display looks for and analyzes in signals. Instead we used a 250-ohm resistor across the signal
output of the transducer and the negative of the power supply. This created a 1V to 5V voltage
from the transducer’s output that we read with a Fluke Multimeter. The wiring diagram for the
pressure transducer is shown below in Figure 27.

41

a multimeter as the device input.

6.10 TOTAL ASSEMBLY (DRAWING NO. A1)
The final assembly of the test rig was assembled at Mustang ’60 machine shop once the
individual parts were manufactured. This assembly was built as per the drawing found in Appendix
O. Each of the socket connections will be joined together using PVC primer and PVC solvent glue,
also known as PVC cement, shown in Figure 27. All socket connections will be cleaned, sanded,
and primed before gluing takes place. The solvent glue that will be used is Harvey P-12 heavy
bodied PVC cement, which is designed to solvent weld schedule 40 and schedule 80 PVC items
up to 12" in diameter. We will also use Harvey Purple Solvent to properly prepare the pipes and
fittings for the cement. The Material Safety Data Sheets for both the cement and primer are found
in Appendix S. Flanged joints will be bolted together with the appropriate sized bolts. For the 6”
flanges on either side of the butterfly valve, we used 3/4” threaded rods and 3/4” washers and nuts
to secure the fitting. For the 4” flanges on either side of the butterfly valve and the orifice plate,
we used 5/8” threaded rods and 5/8” washers and nuts to secure the fittings. Because bolts with
half threads on the shaft would not work with our valves, we needed to cut our own steel rods to
approximately 7” in length. Figure 28 shows how the threaded rods were cut to length with an
abrasive shop saw. The ends of the threaded rods were then beveled on the belt sander.

6.11 OVERALL PROTOTYPE
The overall prototype came together largely following our original design along with new
changes to the testing rig. One major change was the way in which we inserted compressed air
into the piping. Rather than using an air compressor, we used the machine shop’s compressed air.
Another change was the specific pump that we used. Our calculations led us to select the DuroMax
XP904WP gas powered trash pump which we thought we would need to purchase or rent. To
conserve our budget, our sponsor put us in contact with Quinn CAT Rental Services who provided
us with a Multiquip QP4TH pump to rent for free. This added a small change to our designed
system, changing the maximum calculated flowrate we could achieve from the previous 427 gpm
to the new 550 gpm. We also added a second butterfly valve in line with the 4” branch line to allow
for additional flowrate adjustments throughout the system. The orifice plate replaced the second
turbine flowmeter that we had designed for initially, where we then had to design and manufacture
the plate and wiring to the differential pressure transducer. All of these changes can be seen in the
final design CAD rendering in Figure 30 and compared to the actual final prototype in Figure 31
and 32. Figure 33 shows a close up of the butterfly valves that act to regulate the two inlets to the
water tank.

7 DESIGN VERIFICATION & TESTING
After the manufacturing was completed, we were finally able to test the rig. Rather than
the usual product testing such as stress analysis and function assessments, our tests consisted of
determining when a vortex forms, along with other parameters we chose to test for in our Design
Verification Plan. When testing, we had one person operating and closing the valves, while another
group member read the water height in the main line. The third member tabulated the data called
out on a laptop computer. A computer was the only additional tool necessary to complete the
testing phase of the project. Our original objective was to change flowrates in the main and branch
lines and rotate the main line to observe multiple critical submergence depths at which the vortex
forms. To get as many data points as possible, we configured a testing plan. We looked to set up
three trials for each case for the three different offtake angles of the main line, along with closing
the butterfly valve from 0 to 90° in 10° increments to see when a vortex would form. This will
provide us with a total of 90 trials. Unfortunately, this testing did not come to fruition for a few
reasons.

7.1 ORIFICE PLATE CALIBRATION
Before we could begin testing and collecting any data that we could, we first had to
calibrate the orifice plate. There is no flowrate display associated with the orifice, so we had to

46
conduct a procedure using the turbine flowmeter. In order to use the orifice plate to measure flow,
we cut off all of the flow going through the main line, so that all of the flow would be redirected
to the branch line. We then would record the pressure drop using a pressure transducer connected
to the display after setting a flowrate on the pump and reading it from the turbine flowmeter.

7.2 DESIGN ALTERATIONS
Our group had to alter our testing because we found it hard, if not impossible, to rotate the
main line without the flexible hose buckling and kinking. This would just add large pressure losses
and restrict flow through the branch line, defeating the purpose of this machine. Therefore, we
settled with just testing one offtake angle, 90° downward; however, if more time was available, it
would have been possible to test for the three different angles with three separate hoses.

7.3 TESTING COMPLICATIONS
As we began to test for the orifice plate calibration, we noticed that there was only one
readout from the display. Prior, we discussed how we installed a DPDT on/on/on switch on the
back of the display. One of the connections to this switch appeared to be faulty and did not show
a value. To determine which one was defective, we removed the connection to the pressure
transducer and just used a multimeter to read the voltage coming from the device. That left only
the flowmeter, and we found that it was not outputting values to the display. In an attempt to figure
out if there was a loose wire within the flowmeter that would cause it to not transmit a value, we
removed the housing. Because we did not know how the flowmeter was constructed, this removal
allowed water to pour out. During this operation, water landed on the display circuitry and shorted
it out, giving us no way to read a flowrate. At this point, we concluded that we could not get any
numerical, quantitative results from this experiment with the time left in the project schedule, with
only a week left. What followed was an attempt at getting qualitative results to inform the reader
at what point vortexes form.

7.4 TESTING RESULTS
To conduct qualitative testing with the equipment we had left, we followed a procedure
mapped out to us by our sponsor. First, we filled the tank to its maximum height, approximately 6
feet, which allowed us to completely fill the 6” main line, while keeping the branch line closed.
From this point while running the system, we slowly opened the branch line valve to lower the
main line water level, until the air reached about 5, 10, and 15% area at the top of the pipe. These
area percentages correspond to a distance of 0.59, 0.95, and 1.26 inches respectively from the top
of the pipe. At each of these levels, we opened the branch line valve to allow air and water to travel
downward creating the vortex.
When the main line valve is fully open, the majority of the flow passes by the tee and the
stratified flow is not greatly influenced by the branch line. When we close the valve, the water is
slowed down and experiences a hydraulic jump which forces the air out of the way and the water
fills the full bore of the pipe. This traps any air present within the pipe and, as the zone of slow
moving water grows, pushes the hydraulic jump phenomena upstream towards the tee. The

47
location of the hydraulic jump is the cause of gas ingestion because flow disturbance causes
bubbles to break away from the stratified flow, which then get ingested into the branch line.
However, this behavior only occurred when gas accounted for more than around 40% of the crosssectional area.
Another way we tried to get quantitative data was to find the point at which a vortex formed
at full pump speed. Since the flowmeter was inoperable, there was no way to verify the speed at
which the fluid was running at, making it impossible to calculate Froude numbers. However, we
had the pump curve for full operating speed and we knew the maximum speed, so in essence we
could run the system and obtain data for one point. Unfortunately, when attempting to obtain data
at this speed, the hose located at the tee junction almost burst when the main line valve was slowly
closed. When running the system at the same maximum pump speed, but tinkering with
components at a slower pace, we still could not obtain a vortex.

8 CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS
8.1 UNIONS VS FLANGES
One large obstacle of this project was the leakages through unions installed throughout the
testing rig. As stated above in Maintenance & Repair Considerations, we had difficulty completely
tightening the unions to a point where water was not able to escape the system. We first could only
tighten them by hand, which was not enough torque applied to create a perfect seal. After searching
for a strap wrench large enough to fit a 6” or 8” wide union at our local hardware stores, we devised
our own tool consisting of a waist belt and a ratchet strap. This worked well enough to create a
constant seal and stopped the leaks. But this device was far from ideal. We found that the flanges
in our system work well and provide no leaks whatsoever. We would wholly advise the use of
flanges rather than unions in any future development because they are easier to rotate and seal
back up once the main line is at its desired offtake angle.

8.2 USE BULKHEAD FITTINGS ON TANK
We had many issues with water getting past the silicon sealant at the intersecting fitting of
the tank outlet hole and the PVC pipe. We attempted to lather the sealant generously to fill gaps
and make it watertight. Unfortunately, the water often found a way to get past the silicon seal.
Another problem we faced was that as we filled the tank with more volume of water, the pressure
and outward force on the elbow at the tank outlet overpowered the seal and pushed the fitting away
from the tank. Therefore, we recommend purchasing a 6” bulkhead fitting to install at the bottom
outlet to the tank. This would provide a sure way to completely seal this intersection and save days
if not weeks of attempting to re-glue the seal. The only downside is that one of these bulkhead
fittings cost upwards of $300. However, to save money, we used a piece of rectangular wood to
provide compressive support at the pipe outlet to counteract the force of the water flowing out of
the tank and maintain the seal.

48

8.3 FLEXIBLE TUBING ALTERNATIVES
As stated above in Section 7, we were forced to cut the flexible tube for only one offtake
angle measurement due to excessive buckling at the slightest bend. If time permitted or our sponsor
wanted to continue testing with a secondary team, we would recommend looking into other types
of flexible hose that could hold firm their circular shape as one bent the tube.

9 MANAGEMENT PLAN
9.1 TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES
Our group agreed on individual responsibilities regarding this project. Brett was the
communication officer who was the main point of contact with our sponsor and the project team
at PG&E. Brett was also in charge of setting up and coordinating any meetings over the span of
the project, along with relaying topics addressed in meetings to other members, or the sponsor, if
they are absent. Brian acted as the team treasurer, maintaining the team’s travel and materials
budget throughout the project. Ryan was the recorder of meetings and kept track of the team’s
progress of the yearlong project and oversaw the deadlines of deliverables. Regarding team
meeting leads, we decided to share the role when meeting our advisor, sponsor, and as a team.
Also, we ensured that the meeting rules are followed as per our team contract provided to Anderson
Lin on October 6, 2016.

9.2 SCHEDULE
For a clear view of our schedule throughout the year long project, please refer to Appendix
H for a Gantt chart. This chart allowed us to keep on schedule and determine if we were off track.
This provided us with a tool to visually map out every step of the project, from idea generation to
manufacturing dates.
