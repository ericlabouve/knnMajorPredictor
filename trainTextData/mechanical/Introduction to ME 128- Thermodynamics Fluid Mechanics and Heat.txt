One concept that utilizes the modular experimental setup, demonstrating only fluid energy transfer
through a pump using a drill-driven pump and a small custom made turbine. This is essentially what
the pump side of the project design covered, but broken out to create an easier to make assembly.
Small experimental stations like these would be made for the other forms of energy conversion. . . . 44

Executive Summary
This report describes the development of a prototype lab experiment intended to introduce mechanical engineering
students at California Polytechnic State University to concepts in the realms of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics,
and heat transfer. These topics have been neglected in the introduction class for multiple reasons, but the instructing
group feels it is possible to integrate a lab into the class demonstrating basic concepts from these subjects. The
proposed prototype is a self-sufficient energy generating and transfer mechanism. Unfortunately, the primary
project goals of being producible on-campus and for under a specified $500 per unit were not obtained with the
included proposed design. Recommendations for future development, therefore, are also included.

1. Introduction
Introduction to Mechanical Engineering (ME 128) is a class targeted at first year students in the mechanical
engineering department, with the intent of briefly exposing students to each of the major components of the
Mechanical Engineering coursework and potential career opportunities. Aside from an HVAC concentration
introductory lab, this class has neglected to include a specific experiment focused on the subjects of thermodynamics,
fluids, or heat transfer, and these topics represent a significant amount of the ME curriculum. This report describes
a proposed solution, the process of developing the design, and also includes any educational documents required
for the sustainability of the activity.
1.1

Stakeholders

The sponsor of this senior project is Dr. Steffen Peuker. During his time as an instructor, he has noticed that the
current Introduction to ME course lacks completeness in content related to thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and
heat transfer. He, along with the other ME professors involved in ME 128, have called for a team to create a new
experiment, which will replace the current spring lab.
The customers for this project are the future mechanical engineering students who will use the experiment. It is
assumed that they have very little to no experience in dealing with these concepts, therefore it will be important
that the designed experiment covers a contemporary and simple experiment that they can understand.

2. Background
The team conducted extensive research in order to fully understand the proposed project and define a customer
need. This research included reviewing current material in the Introduction to Mechanical Engineering class,
finding effective experiments at other schools, and looking at commercial products.
2.1

Introduction to ME Curriculum

The Introduction to Mechanical Engineering class, ME 128, is the first major-related course that students take at Cal
Poly. It is a hands-on class that gives an overview of what mechanical engineers do at Cal Poly and in the workplace.
ME 128 provides this overview through a series of interactive lab experiments that students complete in groups of
four. The current labs include the disassembly and reassembly of a drill and lawn mower motor, programming a
robot, analyzing an air conditioner, and measuring the spring constant of different springs. While these labs do a
good job of introducing freshman students to mechanical design, mechatronics, and HVAC, they fail to introduce
the students to thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer.
This is a problem since these topics are considered a core part of mechanical engineering and can be found in
roughly 40% of the undergraduate curriculum at Cal Poly. On top of that, many students come in with interests in
thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer but do not know how their interests apply to their major. A
solution to this problem would be the creation of an introductory experiment, similar to the labs currently in ME
128, that introduces these missing topics.
2.2

ASEE Research

To understand how engineering educators are dealing with introducing these topics, references can be drawn
from articles published in ASEE, the American Society for Engineering Education. Numerous professors have
reported on hundreds of experimental education environments, which aim to improve academic practices or,
more importantly, approach a topic from a new angle. To understand difficulties and practices in introducing
thermodynamics and fluids, papers mainly authored by Dr. Michael J. Prince of Bucknell University were found to
be the most relatable.
In one of his papers, Dr. Prince cites the four most commonly misconceived topics in this area as: "(1) temperature
vs. energy, (2) temperature vs. perceptions of hot and cold, (3) factors that affect the rate vs. amount of heat
transferred and (4) the effect of surface properties on thermal radiation" [2]. These are familiar concepts to most
engineering academia, but for incoming students properties such as these can be difficult to grasp or modify

existing misconceptions. Prince proposes that by using a hands-on laboratory based experiment, students better
understand the concepts behind the fundamentals of thermodynamics-based classes. In follow-up reports, he notes
that universities that adopted the proposed curriculum without allowing students to get hands on experience (the
professor does the experiment as a demonstration instead) saw little to no change in the perceptions in students on
the concepts covered [2].
To understand how other universities are achieving similar goals, either with or without Dr. Prince’s advice, ASEE
papers revolving around specific experiments were pulled and referenced. Many of these experiments are or were
designated for a traditional single-topic class, not an introductory class; however the ideas and concepts behind
each experiment have the potential to be combined and modified to meet the ME 128 requirements.
One paper, authored by Dr. Katharyn E. K. Nottis, proposes multiple experiments separated into activities that
exemplify common thermodynamic properties. Each of these activities has a write-up broken down into three
phases: "written prediction (I), an action (II, either experiment or simulation), and written post-processing (III)"
[3]. This is necessary, Nottis explains, as many students "too easily dismiss the results as ’Oh, sure, I thought that
would happen," without a predictory and post-process phase. While Dr. Nottis’ process is seemingly ideal for ME
128, the actual activities proposed in her paper do not reflect the general style of Learn-by-Doing and weekly topic
coverage. The experiments, ranging from entropy to enthalpy to Carnot engines, are round-robin style activities
with short write-ups, not group-centered lab activities with a formal lab write-up as is traditional with ME 128.
Another paper, by Dr. Adrienne Minerick, recommends the use of a Desktop Experiment Module (DEMo) to teach
students. The DEMo system illustrates conduction of various materials, thermal energy generation, thermal contact
resistance, heat dissipation and convection across surfaces through multiple desk size experiments. According to
Dr. Minerick, learning is achieved because "1) each student can closely examine and manipulate the apparatus, 2)
student teams can progress through experiment discovery at their own learning pace, and 3) all learning styles are
stimulated" [4]. Even though the DEMo experiments follow Cal Poly’s Learn-by-Doing philosophy, they overlap
with heat transfer experiments in later courses which is not desired.
Timothy C. Scott’s paper describes a bench top experiment that demonstrates the concepts of free and forced
convection [5]. His experiment setup, which can be found in Figure 1, is notable due to its low cost allowing
multiple units to be built so that students could work in small groups. The low cost aspect of Dr. Scott’s experiment
would be desirable since students in ME 128 work in group of four throughout the quarter. However, his experiment
looks aesthetically lacking and does not match the quality of the current ME 128 experiments.

In regards to fluid mechanics, Dr. Afshin Goharzardeh’s paper provides an overview of two experiments that
investigate fluid flow [6]. These experiments use Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to capture the dynamics of a jet
flow inside a cylindrical enclosure and single phase flow over a backwards facing step (see Figures 2 and 3). Unlike
some of the previous experiments mentioned, the cameras required to implement PIV data collection are extremely
expensive and would not be a feasible option for small groups. Due to this and the complex nature of the topic itself
for Freshman, Dr. Goharzadeh’s experiments were considered not suitable for ME 128.

Reading through the ASEE articles offered the team valuable insight on what methods and experiments professors
from other universities have used to teach thermodynamics, fluids, and heat transfer. However, all of the researched
methods proved to be either too difficult, too specialized, or too expensive for the ME 128 class. Thus, the team
turned to researching commercial educational products in hopes of finding better scoped experiments.
2.3

Cal Poly Senior Projects

In an attempt to find more relatable experiments, previous Cal Poly senior projects were researched. The most
notable project was a lab experiment created in 2015 for the Fundamentals of HVAC class. In the experiment,
students analyze the thermal response of a building under various heating and cooling loads. The apparatus,
shown in Figure 4, consists of a scaled-down model of a building, its control system, and various data acquisition
tools [8].

and record housing heating and cooling in various popular configurations.

This experiment is great since it is a straightforward model of a real world problem, but the total cost is roughly
$5,000 which is way over the budget given. However, most of the cost can be attributed to the advanced control and
data acquisition systems. Overall, this experiment would be an effective way to demonstrate heat transfer concepts
to incoming freshman if a more cost effective and simplified solution is developed.
2.4

PASCO Products

The main (if not only) commercial competitor in this area, which provides mass-manufactured lab experiments,
is PASCO engineering [7]. PASCO provides numerous modular products that cover a wide variety of mechanical
engineering concepts. Their relevant thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer lab products are located
in Attachment A. Figure A1 shows the most complex and encompassing lab experiment, the Heat Engine Efficiency
lab. This experiment uses a hot and cold water bath to expand and contract air within an enclosed chamber, causing
a piston-cylinder to do work on a mass. While this experiment is a fantastic way to demonstrate isobaric cycles, p-V
diagrams, convection, conduction, and fluid statics, the total price for one unit is well over $1,000. Buying six of
these is well outside of the given budget. Additionally, the equipment needed is very bulky and not user friendly,
requiring numerous parts to be set up each time the experiment is to be performed.
PASCO has other well-produced products that are smaller and cheaper, but do not cover as many topics as the
heat engine. Figures A2 , A3, and A4 show some of these products. The Stirling Engine is a single apparatus that
demonstrates fluid work and changes in temperature causing an isochoric system to expand or contract. The Fluid
Flow experiment demonstrates flow rates across different cross sectional areas, as well as drag and reactive changes
in pressure. The Thermal Conductivity Apparatus demonstrates the concept of a thermal circuit for conduction
through various solid materials by melting ice over sample squares. All of these products are either too short in
interaction time, cover too few topics to validate a lab report, or are too expensive for their academic value to Cal
Poly. This sentiment is valid for most of PASCO’s products: While generally "cool," the cost of these experiments is
highly inflated, the content is not dense enough, and there are too many additional product required to make one
product fully functional as a lab. A better solution can be tailor-made here, at Cal Poly, for a much lower cost.

3. Objectives
Based on the team’s research, a problem statement was created to clearly define the need for an introductory
thermodynamic, fluids, and heat transfer experiment. Additionally, input from the team’s sponsor, adviser, and
customer was used to create a list of requirements and specifications for the project.
3.1

Problem Statement

To reiterate, current students in the Introduction to Mechanical Engineering class have no introduction to
thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. These topics represent a significant amount of both future coursework and
are a critical component of engineering problems in the workplace. A new experiment must be designed to excite,
engage, and stimulate students with a contemporary problem. This experiment must be manufactured by the Cal
Poly machine shops and should be relatively low cost compared to on-the-market options.
3.2

Customer Requirements

Aside from the main project sponsor’s requirements, the mechanical engineering professors who traditionally teach
the introductory course have all submitted their own requirements and desires for this project. These ideas have
been solidified into the requirements presented in this section.
The most important aspect of the final product is its durability and reproducibility. The experimental apparatus
will be in the hands of 24+ students for multiple labs a week, every fall quarter. These students are both curious
and unacquainted with lab equipment handling, so the apparatus must account for this. Since there are six stations
in the classroom, an additional five apparatus must be produced following the design documents from the final
project report. This must be done in-house at the Cal Poly machine shops, and with relative ease.
The educational value and "fun-factor" of the experiment succeed these requirements. Being an

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

-5-

introductory class, each and every one of the labs should engage and excite the incoming students, encouraging
them to pursue each of the covered subjects. The ideal way to do this is to mimic an issue or concept commonly
seen in industry. By doing this, the lab introduces the students to not just the upcoming curriculum, but a possible
career path. However, if the lab fulfills this goal, but is boring and uninteresting, this project will have not fulfilled
its purpose.
The final customer requirements involve the lab’s academic quality-of-life. The final project should include an
introductory presentation and a lab report guide for the professor to present to the students before and after the
experiment, respectively. The presentation should outline the concepts behind the upcoming experiment, and
introduce multiple applications of the concepts in the engineering workplace. The lab report guide can have
multiple forms, such as a short document of requirements, or an empty data table which can be investigated with
supplemental questions.
It must be gradable, meaning that the results should be easy to follow and predictable each time the experiment is
performed. Finally, the experiment must be easy to set-up by the professor, and should not over encumber both the
storage area and the lab tables.
3.3

Quality of Function Development Analysis

To generate these engineering specifications, the quality function deployment method was applied to the given
customer requirements. This method allows the project team to materialize high quality engineering specifications
and gauge their importance in the final product and any prototypes. From these generated specifications, correlations
can be formed and levels of importance or focus can be developed. It also allows the project to compare itself to
already existing related products, further solidifying the scope and definition of the final engineering requirements.
Specifications can be drawn out onto a separate table and their risks can be assessed.
The QFD chart for this project is included in Attachment B. The goal of having each engineering specification
correlating with at least one customer requirement in some aspect was achieved, with each specification having a
quantifiable target. Ideally, the specifications generated are the most concentrated and important ones, however
they may change with further input from the sponsor. This QFD iteration is the first of multiple, as the process
is applicable to each phase of the project, up into manufacturing. These future iterations will be appended as the
project progresses.
3.4

Engineering Specifications

The final engineering specifications generated from the QFD are listed in Table 1.
Interestingly but appropriately, the most critical specifications seen by the team are educationally based. Not only
are the times required for each phase of the lab relatively important, but the content of the lab should be valuable.
This means that there should be a distinct number of topics covered, and that they should all be easily observable,
recordable, and presentable.
The manufactured apparatus for the lab is constrained by human abilities and the pre-existing lab stations used
for the class, which are found in Building 13, Room 124. The height, width, and length of the apparatus must not
exceed the maximum safe capabilities of the lab tables. Additionally, the weight of the apparatus must not exceed
that of a medium parcel, so the lab instructor or students can easily transport them from storage to the lab tables.
Since there is no power available at or near these tables, the apparatus should not utilize external power.
Total costs for this project should not exceed $500. This cost includes the price for one experimental apparatus,
any supplemental lab equipment that is shared by the class but is required for the experiment to operate, and any
prototype material. This project budget can be modified if outside funds are acquired, but all successive iterations
of at least the experimental apparatus must cost less than $500. Costs can be curbed by keeping manufacturing
in-house, so the entirety of the project must be manufactured by either the Mustang ’60 or Aero Hangar shops.
Each lab experiment should last more than five years of normal operation, enduring over 40 uses per year during
the fall quarter. During this entire span of operation, it must maintain safety standards seen by all Cal Poly ME lab

equipment. There should be no sharp edges that can expose themselves over time, nor any live wires or moving
parts that are easily accessible.

∗: Medium Risk(M) and Low Risk (L) of feasibility
†: Verification through Analysis(A), Testing(T), Inspection(I), Similarity to Existing Designs(S)
All of these requirements are summarized in Table 1. This table describes the constraints, risks, and validation
methods for each specification. Note that almost all of them are low risk goals, with the only possible issues arising
from the need for more funds or power. The funding could overrun the $500 cap due to the desire for more high-tech
analysis instruments, but this can be remedied if MESFAC funds are allocated for the project. The need for power
is of mild concern since heat transfer without fire or electricity is rather slow or requires a material with high heat
capacity, impacting rapid experimental repeatability. Even with these mild risks, the end product as defined by the
customer is a definite possibility in terms of engineering.

4. Idea Development
With the requirements and specifications locked in, idea generation could begin, with experiment concepts
undergoing testing and comparison against the requirements. From this ideation, a refined final experimental
concept could be molded.
4.1

Ideation

The team performed multiple ideation sessions based on the techniques learned in class. The first session focused
on brainstorming contemporary problems related to thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. Some of
the proposed problems included keeping a train or car engine cool, insulating an average household, measuring
work done by a piston, and simulating thermocline in a water tank. From this session, the team discovered that
almost all contemporary problems would require a significant amount of simplification so that incoming students
would be able to understand them. Additionally, these problems would have to be scaled-down is size in order to
fit within the required footprint.
4.2

Concepts

The first experiment concept was the simulation of a hydroelectric energy plant, seen in Figure 5, by having water
flow from tanks at different heights. This two tank experiment revolves around the contemporary problem of
storing energy during low demand so that it can be used during high demand. The experiment itself introduces
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

-7-

incoming students to the first law of thermodynamics and fluid flow. Ideally, this experiment builds on students
basic knowledge of potential and kinetic energy while introducing dynamic concepts of pipe flow. Students collect
data to analyze efficiency in the system and determine where sources of losses could be found.

Figure 5. A hydroelectric energy storage facility uses the same building to both pump water up a hill and pull
energy from water falling down the hill. During low demand, excess grid energy is used to pump water to the
upper reservoir. During peak hours, water is run down into a turbine. Not much power can be generated from a
small scale version of this facility, but the concepts scale well.
For the next concept, a different method of energy transfer was considered. This experiment concept would use a
cart on an incline to power an attached wind turbine. As seen in Figure 6 this system models an Advanced Rail
Energy Storage (ARES) facility which uses elevated carts to provided additional energy during peak use. Again,
students learn about the first law of thermodynamics and build on their knowledge of potential and kinetic energy.
This experiment aims to stimulate interest in future thermodynamic classes by demonstrating one use of turbine
work. Data similar to the hydroelectric experiment would be recorded and analyzed.

Figure 6. Similar to the hydroelectric storage unit, this rail cart stores potential energy by running up a hill during
low demand, and falling down the hill with a cable or regen brake during peak hours. This device could work to
teach thermodynamic laws on in a more hands-on way than water can.
The team created a modified concept of the HVAC senior project mentioned in Section 2.3. The experiment apparatus
would be similar to the one in the report, except that the advanced controls system would be removed and the walls
of the modified house would have interchangeable material. The reasoning for this is interchangeable material
would give students a hands on introduction to two modes of heat transfer: conduction and convection. Students
would record data such as change in temperature and compare how different materials affect that measurement.
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

-8-

During this process, students would also be introduced to material properties, such as thermal conductivity and
thermal resistivity, and the necessary equations to find them.
4.3

Concept Refinement

Although the ideas created went through judgment during the ideation that tested them against larger customer
requirements, the process of choosing the final project requires a more defined approach. To select an idea as the
seed for the project design, a quantitative weighing technique called a Pugh matrix was used. Pugh matrices weigh
concepts with respect to a set of criterion defined by the customer requirements and engineering specifications. To
simplify later analysis, each concept is weighed against a datum as either better, worse, or the same in terms of the
criteria in question.
To refine the concept pool, an initial Pugh matrix was used to challenge each project concept from ideation against
the others, seen in Figure C1.
The two top contenders were the downhill cart with wind turbine attachment and the double tank fluid flow energy
experiment. These two perform higher than the datum in most categories, but lack in experiment flexibility and
measurement variety. The downhill cart fairs worse, as it does not have much report worthy material aside from
frictional losses and turbine efficiency. Both experiments have the potential to cost the same or more than an
insulated house experiment.
The other designs ranked poorly compared to these two. Radiator efficiency scored third highest against the datum,
but did poorly in the educational sector since it provides no good base knowledge for students to branch off
from. The data center convection cooling experiment, as expected, scored similarly to the datum. It only differs
in the number of data points available to measure and complexity of the assembly due to the need for forced air
convection. The worst scoring concept was the wave generator. While interesting on paper, everything but the
educational content, laboratory recycle time, and data availability were worse than the datum.
With the outcome of the analysis uncertain, a second round of Pugh matrices focused on experimental components
were created. To do this, the top concepts, as well as the datum, were reconfigured and blended. Since the data
center ventilation and insulated house experiments were so similar, they could be easily combined. The result of this
combination is similar to the HVAC building senior project from Section 2.3. The double tank fluid flow experiment
could be used to power the turbine in the potential energy experiment, pulling the cart up the hill.
The double tank fluid flow experiment matrix analyzed the moving car, the incline, the pump impeller, and piping.
To keep the comparison similar to the previous matrix, the insulated wall was also used as the datum. Overall,
the results showed that the components of the two tank system were almost indistinguishable to the components
of the house system. The biggest variations occurred when comparing the relatability and the cleanliness of the
components. It was found that the car on an incline scored better than the insulated wall in relatability since
students could see what was physically happening in the system. On the other hand, the piping in the two tank
system scored worse in cleanliness since the system uses water instead of air.
Using these Pugh matrix results, a final complete system could be conceptualized and presented as a potential
project solution.

5. Final Concept Comparison
The final two overarching concepts, while both within the scope of the project, are very different in character. While
the project is currently leaning towards one over the other, the numbers from the Pugh matrix demand that both be
given equal light before a final decision is made.
5.1

Joule House

Figure 7. A generalized concept sketch of the house apparatus used in the Joule House experiment. Components
shown would be removable, allowing students to observe fluid changes due to hardware configuration.
The Joule House experiment introduces incoming freshman to heat transfer, fluid flow, and basic HVAC components.
This experiment is capable of demonstrating the concepts of convection, conduction, radiation, and incompressible
flow using common components such as ducting, windows, wall insulation, and venting. The experimental
apparatus would be a scaled-down model of a house, similar to the senior project presented in Section 2.3.
In order to focus students on one subject at a time, the house would be modular, so that the experimental components
of the house (i.e. walls, duct size, windows, etc.) would be interchangeable. This modularity would also allow
students to see how changing components effects different engineering parameters like air velocity, temperature
change, thermal conductivity, and thermal resistance. Additionally, it would promote an iterative, inquiry based
experiment, where students predict the effect of the change, observe the change as it physically occurs, and analyze
what actually happened.
Specific component modules in this experiment are insulated walls and windows, venting through horizontal
multi-level surfaces, ducting placement along a thermocline, and radiation from surrounding surfaces. Most all
of these use a warm object in the center of the room, simulating heat-generating objects inside of an enclosure
(such as a human, computer, or appliance). By changing certain component configurations, either one at a time or
in various combinations, the student can predict and observe changes in the object and it’s surrounding’s energy
state. These observations can be made through infrared temperature measurements, or in a more visually appealing
manner with a thermal imaging camera.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

Lecture material for this class would introduce the three modes of heat transfer, general HVAC practices and
principles, and how they are applied and measured in construction. Efficiency, energy from heat, and fluid density
could also be glossed over as introductory interesting points in coursework. The introductory lecture should also
include report writing guidelines to help guide students through the experiment with the mindset of recording their
observations.
5.2

Energy Conversion and Losses

Figure 8. The hydro-powered version of the energy conversion experiment. This version uses a double-tank
energy input to pull water through a turbine via gravity.
The energy conversion and losses experiment would function as a scaled-down model of an energy storage plant.
The experiment could work in two possible ways: by having fluid flow from an upper tank to a lower tank, or by
having air from a high speed fan move through a pipe, with both methods turning a turbine. With the gears in
the first position, the rotation of the turbine shaft would turn a pulley which moves a small weighted car up an
incline. The gears would then be switched to a second position connecting the pulley shaft to a generator shaft,
releasing the car into a gravity-assisted fall. The rotation of the generator shaft would then power a device that
could measure the energy output of the generator. For the water powered system, this could be done by powering
a pump to pump water back to the input tank, where the change in volume can be measured. In the air powered
system, a lamp, kill-a-watt, or fan can be used to measure energy output. A picture of the described apparatus can
be seen in 8, with the air-type system shown in Figure 9.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 11 -

Figure 9. This alternative energy conversion and losses experiment uses air instead of water to power the input
shaft. Not shown is the necessary gearing required to turn the input fan at a high RPM to achieve maximum
airflow under human power.
This experiment introduces students to the first and second law of thermodynamics, conservation of mass, and
pipe flow. By measuring energy at multiple points, students can estimate and observe energy loss through a simple
mechanical system. Using the first law of thermodynamics and basic energy equations, students can predict the
ideal energy transfer without losses. Then, using various velocities, masses, and power measurements, students
can measure actual energy loss as power is transmitted through the system. If possible, students can try to rig up a
"potential energy machine" by connecting the input fluid flow to the output fluid flow (or by letting water continue
to pump if water is used). By doing this, students can inquire about and observe the second law of thermodynamics
in a physical example. By observing fluid flow at the input and output (through pressure or velocity), advanced
students can answer questions on fluid losses and laminar pipe flow.
The introductory lecture would introduce the first two laws of thermodynamics, and provide students with enough
background to start the experiment. It may also introduce report writing guidelines, to ensure that the instructor
does not need to rush the end of the period. The concluding lecture can consist of examples of systems who see
problems similar to those in the lab constantly, and can discuss hydroelectric storage options which use energy
storage and conversion to supply high demand energy periods.

5.3

Recommended Choice

While these two choices for the experimental concept are conceptualized and can be manufactured with relative
ease, a final decision had to be made. The team recommended the pursuance of the energy conversion and losses
experiment. The main reason for this choice is the tangibility of the experiment; the student changes multiple
physical variables throughout the experiment, directly observing the consequences of the choices, allowing for open
questions in the lab manual. In contrast, the house experiment uses solely air as its dependent variable generating
material, which is not visible, even in a thermal imaging camera. While less modular than the house experiment, the
energy conversion experiment’s single iteration loop can help students focus on the concepts being covered rather
than the procedure of the experiment. It also anchors onto high school level physics concepts that are expanded
upon in college, while the house experiment introduces mostly brand new law, equations, and theory.
5.4

Final Overall Selection

Figure 10. The final concept sketch completed before solid modeling began. Note the full gearbox and belt drive,
which were later omitted to reduce costs.
While the team decided to go with the overall energy conversion theme, a few changes had to be made to ensure that
the experiment would work properly. Instead of having the fluid fall to power a closed loop system, a mass would
be dropped to power three separate subsystems. The final proposed system, sketched in Figure 10 is explained in
detail in the following section.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 13 -

6. Final Design
The final design of the experiment introduces incoming students to the conservation of energy. It does this by
converting potential energy to kinetic energy, rotational energy, and electrical energy. The experiment starts by
dropping a mass at a specific height to turn a shaft. The rotational motion of the shaft is then transfered through a
series of gears and pulleys to either pull the cart up the ramp, turn the pump impeller, or power the light bulb. The
final design of the experiment can be seen in Figure 11.

Figure 11. CAD model of the overall experiment.
As seen from above, the experiment includes six subsystems: housing, pulley and mass, power transfer, potential
energy conversion, pump, and electrical. Additionally, the experiment includes a heat engine subsystem that is not
pictured. A detailed description of each subsystem can be found in the following sections.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 14 -

6.1

Housing and Base Subsystems

Figure 12. Housing subsystem placed onto the base subsystem.
The base and housing subsystems, while separate on paper, are closely related. Both act together to create a safe
and fun tool for students to utilize without contributing much to the actual engineering being observed.
The base subsystem is constructed completely with 0.125" thick 6061-T6 sheet metal. High strength aluminum was
chosen for its durability and weight, which are important for constant handling and storage. The main plate is a
CNC-slotted for precision location of the housing walls and other components. Holes for the pulleys, winch, and
oil drain screw are also machined on. Welded to the base are cleats which allow the system to rest on the edge of a
table in a manner that restricts it from tipping when a large mass is dropped. These cleats are attached using a TIG
fillet weld.
One edge of the base hangs off the side to allow the pulley-mass system to drop its mass off the side of the table.
This cantilever section has the potential to deflect, however since it is so close to the anchored base at 0.95", the
shear stresses experienced by the aluminum plate are minimal. With a 30lb weight, the maximum deflection seen
by the plate would by under 0.001". This is the only loading concern with this subsystem.
The housing subsystem, which consists of any walls and most supports, is made entirely out of sheet acrylic. This
material was chosen over the main competitor, polycarbonate, due to its manufacturability and material properties,
and over metals for its transparency and weight. Additionally, acrylic is one of the cheapest options for this
subassembly.
It is important that the walls remain as transparent as possible so data and observations can be recorded by students
for many years. Polycarbonate yellows after some time, while acrylic does not. Polycarbonate also has the ability
to become toxic under some circumstances, while acrylic remains inert.
Acrylic can be cut on the laser cutters at Mustang ’60, an important factor in respects to meeting our customer
requirement of complete in-house manufacturing. Polycarbonate does not break cleanly when cut by a laser, and
must be deburred imprecisely, which also mars the surface transparency.
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 15 -

All like sides of the walls will be cemented using acrylic glue, which chemically reacts with the acrylic to melt the
edges and create a permanent, airtight bond. To attach to metals, a silicon caulking will be used. Note that this
method forbids any lifting of the system from the walls, which will be included in a warning on the final device.
If necessary, a hinged door can be added to the lid, allowing for maintenance of the pump. This can be added
with ease, however it would compromise the airtightness of the pump system. If maintenance is required, it is
recommended that the acrylic be pried from the base since there is already an opening allowing access to the gear
system.
6.2

Pulley and Mass Subsystem

The power input for the experiment is falling weights. For the weight to transmit their gravitational potential
energy a pulley and winch system must be used. For this there is a range of different sized weights, which fall at
the same height. The vertical falling motion is converted to rotary motion through a winch system as can be seen in
Figure 13.

Figure 13. CAD model of the mass-pulley system. Attachment of mass is shown by the red line while the red circle
outlines winch drum
6.2.1

Analysis

The main analysis that needed to be completed was to see if enough energy was produced from the falling mass to
power the three subsystems. Basic dynamics was performed to get the output rpm of the winch gear that would go
into the power transmission system. The main values that were needed to do this analysis were the drum diameter
and the gear ratio between the drum and the output shaft. The following set of equations show how the output
rpm was derived from the falling weight.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

First, knowing that the force on the drum is just the weight of the mass which is given by :
f = m ag

T = f rD

Where:
m = input mass
a g = acceleration due to gravity

The number rotations made in each fall is simply found out by:
N=

2 π rD

(7)

Where:
N = no. of revolutions
Finally the angular velocity of the drum can be found by :
ωD =

N 60s
t 1min

(8)

Where:
ω D = angular speed of the drum
The final output to the shaft that will connect to the power transmission is simply found using the gear ratios :
rpmos = ω D R

(9)

Where:
R = gear ratio
rpmos = output speed of the mass-pulley system
From the above derivation, Figure 14 was plotted to show a relationship between the input mass that falls and the
output rpm. With that relationship, the minimum mass required to power the system was be found. Additionally,
the negative concavity of the graph showed that increasing the mass had diminishing return on rpm, thus giving
the team an upper limit for mass.

Figure 14. Relationship between input mass and output RPM.

- 18 -

Using excel to curve fit the data points with a power fit, an equation to relate input mass to output rpm is found to
be :
rpmos = 31.148 m0.5

(10)

The tachometer that will be purchased has a minimum reading of 50 rpm. With Equation 10 the minimum input
mass required for that speed is around 2.5 lbs.
The final estimated input power (in Watts) to the various energy converting subsystems is found by :
Pin =

The relationship between estimated input power and the initial mass that is dropped can be seen below in figure 15

Equation 12 :

(12)

Durability

The winch is designed for a load capacity of 350 lbs (lowest size available) , however the maximum weight that the
experiment will have is 10 lbs. This experiment would only be used 50 hours per year, so no significant lifetime
calculations needed to be calculated. The gears on the winch will be adequately lubricated and should not undergo
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 19 -

any major wear. The only component of the mass-pulley system that will need maintenance is the rope for the
winch. However, this is standard stock 3/16" Nylon rope which is cheap and can be easily replaced. Once students
notice any fraying the professor can simply swap out the rope. This rope is rated to hold a 36lb load which is around
300% heavier than the expected maximum mass of 10 lbs.
6.2.3

Concept Modeling

Students can imagine the falling mass as a gravitational power source such as a hydroelectric dam, a counterweight
on an elevator, or even a pile driver. All of these systems store energy by leaving it in a higher elevation energy
state. This energy is then released and captured using some other mechanism. The mass in question does not have
to be solid, nor does it have to be attached by a rope. Roller coasters, for example, constantly use potential energy
to self propel. Certain gliders can power their electrical systems by falling towards the earth against the resistance
of the air, spinning bladed turbines to generate shaft power. These are some of the examples that can be covered in
the introduction presentation when discussing energy engineering applications.

Power Transfer Subsystem

Figure 16. The power transfer subassembly.
The heart of the assembly is the power transfer system, which acts as a pseudo gearbox that transfers rotational
motion from the winch to the other three subsystems in the box. The goal of this system is to transfer power while
introducing losses through multiple types of rotary components including gears, dogteeth, and pulleys.
6.3.1

Overview

Power transfer is the largest subsystem, and is easiest to outline by following the path of the transmitted forces. The
winch has a gear on the main spindle, which turns a pinion attached to the handle assembly. There is a clearance
behind this winch assembly that allows a 32-tooth gear to be hooked up to the winch pinion. This gear has a
keyway, which allows it to permanently attach itself to a steel shaft. The shaft is supported by delrin bushings
glued to acrylic supports.
This steel shaft is only keyed to the gear and a special dogtooth gear. This gear, which rotates with the shaft, has
coarse teeth which require little precision to engage with any mating gears. This makes it easier for students to
engage the different systems and reduces the amount of moving parts of the subassembly. The lever for this shifter
is attached by a steel fork, which slides over the shifter. The lever and fork are supported by an acrylic mount with
a delrin bushing.

To connect to the two systems, pulleys have been recycled from the old ME 128 lawnmower racers lab. These
pulleys have a large cast iron outcropping with a set screw hole, which can be machined with teeth fairly easily,
allowing for easy engagement with the opposing dogteeth. These pulleys will be allowed to spin freely on the shaft
until engaged by the shifter. From these two, pulley power will be transfered by either rotational motion or spooling
of wire.
6.3.2

Analysis

The use of dogteeth not only makes manufacturing easier but reduces the worry of gear tooth stresses. Initial
revisions of the subassembly used four different gears, the one input gear and three other gears used in a traditional
shifter fashion along a translating shaft. This system, however, proved to have significant losses at the designed
operating conditions. While a gear reduction would have been interesting for students to investigate, the chances
of the final system not working as intended was too high. Thus, a direct power system works much better for us,
and still allows students to perform a gear calculation on the input gearing (if so desired).
For the input, the gearing has a 32-tooth gear on the winch going into a 10-tooth pinion. When an additional
32-tooth gear is attached as the shaft input gear, the 10-tooth pinion becomes an idler gear, resulting in a 1:1 gear
ratio. Students should be able to calculate and observe this fact by monitoring the speed of the gears as a mass falls,
and by performing gear calculations which were introduced during the drills lab. Another added benefit of the 1:1
system is the direct relationship between the height of the mass dropped and the travel distance of the cart. Ideally
they would be the same, but the weight of the cart may sometimes forbid this from occurring.
The input gear, made of hardened steel, is overbuilt for the system. AGMA calculations proved to be rather helpless,
since most calculation constants expect much higher speeds and loads. Even for the maximum expected torque with
a mild shock loading factor added, the shear factor of safety is well above the acceptable limit. For the gears on
the winch, the manufacturer specifications rate them to lift at least 300 pounds vertically, more than enough for this
system’s needs.
The pulleys are made of zinc cast-iron, with the teeth of the dogtooth section measuring about 3/8" in thickness.
Assuming the teeth are cantilever beams with a point load on the end, the overall bending stresses are negligible.
If frictional wear from engagement shreds the teeth, the dogtooth design would have no issues engaging. If wear
becomes serious, a manufactured replacement is recommended.
6.3.3

Concept Modeling

By integrating multiple forms of rotary power transmission components, this system helps exemplify the many
ways that rotary power is handled in numerous applications. The gear system calls back to the drills lab, and
shows how gears can be power sources without requiring manual turning. The v-belt system demonstrates a simple
accessory system used commonly in large machine parts where gearing does not fit, and where costs do not allow
for a more complex system. Students can also be introduced to belts which are off-axis, attached to multiple pulleys
(like in a modern car engine), or in lightweight designs in the place of a chain and sprocket.

Figure 17. The dogtooth insert inside a modern racing gearbox. These parts are crucial to the design of the
gearbox, as they allow for power transfer between gear reductions withing a very small footprint.
The dogtooth system introduces students to a common but rarely seen component inside modern day gearboxes.
This critical component has allowed the design of a manual transmission to reduce its footprint significantly since
the early days of automobiles. As seen in Figure 17, they are used in multiple locations with multiple shifting forks.
By showing a very simple model of the dogtooth system, students can add a new tool in their design toolbox for
use in future projects.
This system is also important in that is creates the losses that students must analyze. These types of losses exist
in powertrain systems everywhere, and are remedied many different ways (bearings, bushings, face width, tooth
count, etc). Some of these methods and applications can be covered in the intro presentation. Conceptualizing
and observing these types of losses, be it directly through this system or through comparison of other connected
systems, is crucial to understanding the first and second law of thermodynamics and the idea of a non-reversible
process.

Potential Energy Conversion Subsystem

Figure 18. Potential energy conversion subsystem.
The potential energy conversion subsystem is the simplest energy conversion subsystem to understand in the
experiment. Similar to the power transfer system, it introduces freshman to losses that occur from static and kinetic
friction of rolling objects. When the system is engaged with the power transfer shaft, the pulley underneath the
ramp gets spooled, thus pulling the cart up the track.
Both the ramp and ramp base will be cut to size from .118" thick acrylic sheet. The ramp base will be located with a
slot on the housing and bonded with an acrylic bonding agent. The ramp will then be bonded on to the ramp base
at a 25◦ angle. The ramp will also be slotted towards the top to fit the 1/8" braided rope. Additionally, horizontal
pulleys will be mounted on both the housing and ramp with 3/16" fasteners. The track will be purchased online
as Code 80 Flextrack and glued onto the ramp. A standard Atlas boxcar was selected as the cart for the subsystem.
Due to the difficulty to calculate the exact losses in the power transfer system, it was decided that the mass of the
cart would be determined through testing.
Through this subsystem, students would observe that the cart can never move up the ramp on its own. They would
also see that the max height of the cart would never reach the height of the initial mass. Students can then compare
the efficiency of the PE change to the efficiency of the rpm and determine what causes those differences if any.
6.4.1

Concept Modeling

Although the conversion from potential energy to potential energy may seem pointless to the students, the first
and second law of thermodynamics are easiest to demonstrate here. While the students are observing the first law,
they can also see how the flow of energy could be reciprocated for practical use and real world applications. As
mentioned in section 4.2 with the concept of the advanced rail energy storage, the idea of a cart (in this case a train
car) running up the hill storing potential energy, can easily be related to the experimental model with the weighted
toy car. The basic concept of storing potential energy (at a loss) can also be seen in the hydro storage plants seen in
various high demand areas around the world.

Pump Subsystem

The pump subsystem aims to introduce students to the concept of fluid energy as well as show them what a
miniature centrifugal pump looks like. It consists of the large pulley, the pump pulley, the pump shaft, the pump,
and SAE 10W oil that submerges the pump. Additionally, a steel ruler will be attached to the back wall of the pump
housing to measure head height. A picture of the subsystem without oil and the housing can be seen in Figure 19
below.

Figure 19. The pump subsystem.
When the system is engaged, the large pulley turns the smaller pump pulley which is connected to the pump shaft.
The shaft then turns the impeller which produces head. The large pulley will have a diameter of 3.5" while the
pump pulley will have a diameter of 1" giving a ratio of 3.5:1. The pump shaft will be connected to the pump pulley
by using a set screw and will be stepped down from .5" diameter to .25". This end will be glued into the pump
impeller. A detailed breakdown of the pump and its components can be seen in Figure 20.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 24 -

Figure 20. Exploded view of the pump.The three components include the main housing, the impeller, and the
housing cover.
As seen from above, the pump consists of three main components: the main housing, the impeller, and the housing
cover. In order to get an initial estimate of the pump size, a 2.25"x2.625"x3" Little Giant 1-EUAA-MD aquarium
pump was borrowed from Dr. Andrew Kean and referenced. During disassembly of the Little Giant, it was found
that there was no easy way to attach the impeller shaft to the stepped down pump shaft. It was also found that most
standard aquarium pumps operated though use of an electromagnetic motor which increased the overall size of the
pump. With this information, it was decided that the best course of action would be to 3D print a pump similar
to the Little Giant but with an easily accessible impeller shaft and smaller dimensions. The final dimensions of the
pump are 1.88" long, .75" wide, and 2.38" tall.
The pump was then analyzed to ensure that the falling mass would produce enough head for students to measure.
The following equations detail the process used.

z2 = h pump − h L

(15)

Recall that h pump is equal to:
h pump =
Where:
Wsha f t = Work of the shaft
m f luid = mass of the SAE 10W oil
Finally this leaves:
z2 =

Ẇsha f t
− hL
ṁ f luid g

(16)

For these calculations, it was assumed that the mass of the SAE 10W oil is equal to its density times the volume in
the pump. It was also assumed that the head loss term could be dropped due to head losses being hard to quantify
at low rpms. Instead, that loss was lumped into the overall inefficiencies of the power transfer through the system.
A conservative value of 40% efficiency was used. The minimum head height was calculated to be 0.8 inches while
the maximum head height was calculated to be 7.5 inches. Table 2 below shows the relationship between input
mass and the height of pump head.

Using the steel ruler mentioned previously, students will be able to record head height for various masses. Then by
using the simplified version of Bernoulli’s (Equation 16), students can compare how much head the initial power of
the mass falling before going through the power transfer subsystem to the actual head measured. Students would
identify potential areas of loss in the system.

6.5.2

Concept Modeling

While the pump subsystem may seem very simplified, it has multiple real world applications that can be mentioned
to students after the experiment is completed. Professors can describe this subsystem as part of an hydroelectric
storage facility that takes cheap or unused energy and stores it for later. In this scenario, the falling mass would be
imagined as the unused energy source and the resulting head would be the stored energy. Professors could then tell
the students to imagine what would happen if all the pumped oil was saved in a higher reservoir and the system
was ran in reverse. This would spark an open discussion on efficiency and feasibility of real world storage plants.
Another topic for discussion would be the similarities and differences between the different types of pumps. Most
students coming into college with a basic understanding of a positive displacement pumps, such as a bike pump,
but lack knowledge of centrifugal pumps and their uses. This topic could be covered by a quick lecture at the start
of class or through pictures found in the students experiment manual.
6.6

Electrical Subsystem

Figure 21. Isolated view of the electrical subsystem, which passively converts mechanical motion into electricity.
The LED light indicator is based off a simple rotating generator. Using a 12V laboratory motor placed in parallel
with the main power transfer shaft, a small amount of current can be produced to power a low-wattage LED placed
on the lid of the housing.
The design of this system is relatively passive and isolated. The motor chosen offers almost no magnetic resistance,
and the LED has a high efficiency, requiring less than 1 Watt. These factors combined turn on the light whenever
the shaft is rotating at any of the designed operating speeds.
If available, students can use an ammeter to measure current and voltage passing through the wires as the shaft
turns. From these, power can be calculated and compared to the input shaft’s power.
6.7

Heat Engine Subsystem

This subsystem is not part of the designed assembly, but is a deliverable required to meet the customer requirements
for this specific design. To encompass the complete range of energy types, heat must also be covered in some form.
Since the designed assembly cannot create heat energy in any form that is engaging or interesting (frictional wear),
a more igniting example can be integrated into the lab.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 27 -

Figure 22. A model temperature differential engine similar to that which will be purchased for demonstration
purposes.
To demonstrate the conversion of stored energy into heat and mechanical energy, a small model alcohol burning
engine will be purchased online. These small engines are relatively cheap compared to lower differential engines,
such as the Sterling engine. One or two engines will be placed on the back table of the room, where the lecturer
will call up groups one by one, showing how the engine works and how the energy input creates a thermodynamic
cycle within the piston-cylinder system.
To help students quantify how much energy is being produced, a tachometer will be attached to the flywheel of the
engine, reading RPMs of the engine. From this value, students can compare the power of the heat system to the
main system and its various energy outputs.
To ensure the engine is operated in a safe manner, students will be forbidden from contacting any part of the
engine. This rule will be enforced by a small blast shield, or piece of sheet acrylic. The lecturer can reach from the
side and demonstrate the kick start required to start the engine oscillations, and then allow the students to take
measurements.
Alcohol, if spilled onto the wooden table surfaces, combusts at a generally low temperature, giving anybody around
a good amount of time to extinguish the flame before the table itself combusts (if it does combust at all). The multiple
layers of errant hot glue strands on the tables should also protect them from any fire hazards.

7. Manufacturing
7.1

Manufacturing Timeline

As required by the customer, all manufacturing was done in-house by either the team or by a member of the Cal
Poly Shop staff. A visual guide of the original plan is available as a Gantt Chart in Attachment H. However, due
to many setbacks and delays, the original timing was not achieved. The biggest issue that the team faced was not
finding a shop technician who was available to CNC the baseplate slots at the end of winter/start of spring quarter.
This caused a chain of delays as the team had to find alternative methods to manufacture the baseplate correctly.
The team took steps to limit the delay as mush as possible by focusing on manufacturing all of the other components
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 28 -

while the baseplate issue was being resolved. This helped considerably but the team was still unable to make up
all of the lost time. The failure to get the baseplate slots CNC’d also created many problems during the assembly
of the experiment since the slots were a critical feature for location and fit of the remaining components. These
problems, along with the complexity of the initial experiment design lead to the team barely being able to complete
the manufacturing in time.
7.2

Baseplate and Acrylic Housing

The first component that was planned to be manufactured was the baseplate. Initially, the team wanted CNC-cut
slots and holes for precision placement. It was estimated that CAM work and consultation would have taken
approximately 30 minutes from when the shop tech received the CAD file. Machine setup would have taken another
30 minutes, followed by the operation itself, which was estimated to take 20-30 minutes. All of this would have
resulted in a manufacturing time of roughly 1.5 to 2 hours.
However, since the team was not able to find someone to CNC the baseplate in an appropriate amount of time,
other measures had to be taken. After consulting with the IT department, the team decided to cut the baseplate on
the IT Department’s waterjet machine. The plate design was modified to make the locating slots go through the
material since the waterjet does not regulate depth. This resulted in the cuts creating a path with tabs as seen in
Figure 23.Using the waterjet was beneficial as the CNC operation would have caused chatter in the material as it cut
a long thin strip. Additionally, the vice on the IT department’s CNC machines were too small for the baseplate to
fit. Unfortunately, a mishap during the cutting caused one of the slots to become slightly misaligned, which made
it harder to fit the acrylic housing in.

Figure 23. Baseplate of the experiment with locating rectangular through slots.
After the baseplate was cut, the gussets and cleats needed to be cut from the stock aluminum sheet. This could
have been done on the vertical bandsaw and then sanded to a nice finish. However, after some consultation with
the mustang 60 shop techs, it was found to be easier to simply just waterjet all the smaller pieces too. The gussets,
cleats, ramp support, and bushing holders were all waterjet to achieve a precise cut.
The actual cutting time required to waterjet all the aluminum components was relatively short. However, the IT
Department lab, where the waterjet is located, is only open for a few hours a week and can become very crowded.
This will not be a a problem in the future as a new (or refurbished) waterjet is said to be opened in the near future
for the ME department.

The acrylic housing was primarily manufactured on a laser-cutter in the M60 shop. In order to use the laser-cutter,
an appointment had to be set up in the M60 office beforehand. Preparation to use the laser-cutter was key since
the operation window was limited to only 3 hours. First, a DXF file of the desired cut lines was created in Adobe
Illustrator and placed on a USB drive. Then, the 24"x2" acrylic sheet was cut on the table saw into a 18"x24" piece
and a 6"x24" piece since the laser-cutter bed is 18"x36". With these two steps complete, the acrylic was ready to be
cut on the laser-cutter.
The laser-cutter was able to cut all of the housing pieces successfully except one, which was the outer housing cover
(pictured in Figure 24). For this piece, the cutter was unable to fully cut out the lever and lock-nut holes that helped
locate the winch lever. The easiest method to fix this was to use a hole saw to remove the remaining material.
However, more complications with the holes followed.

Figure 24. Outer acrylic housing wall. From left to right the holes are as follows: shaft hole (left), lever hole
(middle), and lock-nut hole (right).
After placing the winch on the baseplate, it turned out that the lever hole and lock-nut hole were not correctly
located on the acrylic. The team tried to fix this issue by widening the lever hole with the largest stepped drill bit
possible but the lever was still unable to fit. The lock-nut hole was able to be re-drilled and was able to fit the nut but
the winch lock was eventually removed (reasoning behind this decision is found in Section 7.5). Furthermore, the
team used a hole saw to create an additional hole that allowed the driveshaft to be inserted easier during assembly.
The final acrylic operations arose from the baseplate being cut out on the waterjet instead of CNC’d. Locating tabs
had to be cut into the bottom of the acrylic so that the housing pieces could fit into the baseplate. These tabs were
simple to make and were done on the wood bandsaw in the shops. The pieces of the acrylic housing were also
slightly over-sized, so the edges were sanded down on the belt sander until proper fit was achieved.

7.3

Drivetrain

The manufacturing of the drivetrain was mainly completed through the use of manual machines in the shop. These
machines include the lathe, mill, and drill press. The following paragraphs contain a detailed description of the
processes required to manufacture all the components necessary to assemble the drivetrain. A picture of the fully
assembled drivetrain can be seen in Figure 25.

Figure 25. Top view of drive train with all power transmission components from mass-pulley to pump and cart
subsystems.
The driveshaft was manufactured first due to its critical role in locating all the other components in the system. To
start, a 3/4" diameter 1045 carbon steel keyed shaft was faced to length on the manual mill. Part of the shaft was
then turned down to 1/2" diameter in order to fit the pulleys and dogtooth gear. Due to the keyway causing an
interrupted cut, both the facing and turning processes required a slower spindle speed. Once the lathe operations
were complete, a keyway was milled into the 1/2" diameter portion of the shaft. This was achieved by securing the
shaft on the vise with a v-block and a scrap piece of wood underneath. To create the 3/16" keyway a 1/8" endmill
was used. The milled keyway ended up being slightly small so a Dremel was used to widen the slot to allow the
key to fit. Finally, the entire shaft was sanded down to allow for all the the components to fit with some clearance.
The driveshaft can be seen pictured in Figure 25.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 31 -

Figure 26. Keyed driveshaft.
The most difficult manufacturing operation was creating the dogtooth gear correctly. In order to prep for the final
part, two practice pieces were cut out of 1" diameter 1018 carbon steel round bar stock on the steel chop saw. A
rotating 4-jaw chuck head, pictured below, was then set up on the knee mill to allow the part to rotate 360 degrees.

Figure 27. Rotating 4-jaw chuck head that can be set up on a knee mill.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 32 -

A bore finder was used in order to center both the chuck head and part in relation to the spindle on the mill. This
process was very tedious since the bore finder needed to be used twice while setting up. First, the chuck head had
to be centered along the x and y axes by checking the inner diameter of the 4-jaw opening. Then, the part was be
centered in the 4-jaws by checking the outer diameter of the part and adjusting the x and y axes accordingly. Once
the part was centered, five cuts were made with a 5/16" endmill 72 degrees apart. The first attempt can be seen in
Figure 28.

Figure 28. First attempt at creating the dogtooth.The five cuts are clearly not centered on the part.
As seen from above, the first attempt at creating the dogtooth was extremely poor. It turned out that the part was
not completely centered in the 4-jaws which severely disoriented the part as it rotated during the operation. This
problem stemmed from the part being placed off-center in the 4-jaw chuck when it was initially clamped which
made it harder to center. To correct for this, the part was placed as close to the center before being clamped in the
chuck in order to reduce the error at the start. Furthermore, after each rotation, the endmill was brought down over
the part to check that it was still centered. These changes yielded much better results as evidenced by the second
attempt pictured in Figure 28.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 33 -

Figure 29. Second attempt at creating the dogtooth. Better centering resulted in a better cutting pattern.
With the trial runs completed, the final part was ready to be made. The leftover round stock was placed on a lathe
and then faced to ensure that the edge was flat. A 1/8" deep groove was then cut into the part using an 1/8" parting
tool. The groove was widened to roughly 1/4" using the standard facing and turning tools available. Next, a 1/2"
hole was drilled a little over an inch deep. Following that, the piece was cut to length (1") using a parting tool
and the milling operations described previously were performed on both ends. Finally, a keyway was milled out
between two of the dogteeth using an 1/8" endmill for the initial cut and a 1/16" endmill to reduce rounded corners.
The finished dogtooth can be see in Figure 30.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 34 -

Figure 30. Finished dogtooth gear.
After the dogtooth was completed, the 2" pulley and 3.5" pulley corresponding to the ramp and pump subsystems
respectively, were manufactured next. These pulleys, which were handed down by the ME Department, came with
a setscrew extrusion that was to be modified into dogteeth. The manufacturing process was almost identical to the
creation of the dogtooth gear except no lathe work was necessary. The pulleys were again placed in the 4-jaw chuck
and centered using the bore finder method explained above. Like the dogtooth, the pulleys were cut five times 72
degrees apart. However, a smaller 3/16" was used. The pulleys can be seen in Figure 31.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 35 -

Figure 31. Pump and ramp pulleys with dogteeth milled out.
One change that cannot be seen in the pictures above was that the setscrew dogtooth was was completely removed.
This was because the area around the setscrew was thicker than the other four dogteeth and caused major fit
problems with the dogtooth gear. The justification for removing the setscrew dogtooth completely was that the
setscrew hole already impacted the structural strength of the tooth, the other four teeth provided enough engagement
to the gear, and that there was no easier alternative to make all of the components fit.

Figure 32. The extrusion on the drivetrain gear was faced down to fit within the subassembly.

- 36 -

Another important part of the drivetrain system was the large gear (pictured in Figure 32) that would serve to
transmit the rotary motion of the winch to the subsystems. It was bought to mesh with the smaller gear in the
winch. The gear however, had a keyway extrusion that needed to be removed. At first this seemed like a challenge
since the gear was made out of hardened steel, but, after consultation with shop techs it could easily be faced down
on a lathe using a carbide tip.
The bushing supports were made using the rectangular pieces of aluminum cut from the waterjet. The two busing
supports that supported the large gear were already the correct length, but the shifter bushing support and the
pulley bushing support were not. These two supports were cut on the vertical bandsaw then filed so that the
driveshaft and shifter would be correctly aligned. The holes in the bushing supports were drilled on the drill press.
These holes had to be drilled in incrementally increasing steps as the finished hole size was 11/16".
The four bushings were created out of 1" diameter PTFE delrin rod. These bushings were easily made on the lathe
since delrin is very easy to cut. Each bushing was created with the same four steps. First, the rod was faced to create
a flat surface. Next, the rod was turned down to the desired diameter. Then, a hole was drilled into the rod. Finally,
the rod was parted to length.
One of the components that was planned to be manufactured outside of ME Department shops was the shifter fork.
Ideally, the shifter fork would have been waterjet in the IT Department at the same time as the other aluminum
parts but was not done so. This lead to a time conflict since the waterjet was extremely busy towards the end of
the quarter. This resulted in the shifter fork being cut to shape out of scrap aluminum on the vertical bandsaw and
filed. A 1/4-20 tapped hole was then added so that the shifter knob could be screwed on. Alternatively, the shifter
fork could have be manufactured on the plasma cutter in the hangar. The shifter fork took about 45 minutes of
machining time to complete.
7.4

Pump and Pump Shaft

The pump shaft was made out of the same 1" PTFE delrin rod used for the bushings. First, the rod was roughly cut
on the miter saw. That piece was then faced to length on the lathe. Additionally, the shaft was turned down to 1/2"
diameter and stepped down to 1/4" diameter halfway through. Some extra sanding was done on both halves of the
shaft to allow for a clearance fit with the pump impeller and pump pulley.
The pump itself was 3D printed in Building 13’s Stratasys 3D printer under Larry Coolidge’s supervision. Unlike
some of the other 3D printing stations on campus, such as Innovation Sandbox, an appointment must be set up
with Larry in advance in order to use the printer. Larry suggested some minor design modifications during the
3D printing appointment to make the pump stronger and easier to manufacture. His suggestion was to add fillets
to some of the sharp corners which the team abided by. Once the changes were made, the pump’s position in the
printer bed was set on the computer and the job was run. Larry handled the dissolution of the support media and
had the pump ready for pickup after 2 days. However, the total required time was influenced by other components
that were being printed simultaneously. For this job alone, the three pump components would have taken roughly
12 hours plus the time required to dissolve the support material. The final manufactured pump can be seen in
Figure 33 below.

7.5

Mass, Winch, and Pulley

There was not much manufacturing involved with the Mass-Pulley subsystem since it consisted of buying the
winch, the pulley, the rope, and the weights. The only notable manufacturing was done on the winch to allow it
to turn easier as the weight falls. The spring loaded lock and lock-nut were removed so that the winch could turn
without getting locked as the weight falls. On top of that, two washers were added to the shaft of the large gear
to keep the gear engaged throughout the the weights entire fall. These modifications resulted in some additional
noise as the weight falls but was deemed negligible. The purchased weights are small fishing weights which were
chosen for their small size but heavy weight. The fishing weights also have a loop at the top of them so that they
can easily be attached to a carabiner. Figure 34 shows the set up of this subsystem.

Final Assembly

The experiment was assembled in multiple steps in an attempt to limit the amount of problems that could have
arose from a rushed assembly. The acrylic housing was done first, followed by the drivetrain and mass pulley
subsystems, then the pump subsystem, and finally the cart subsystem. The fully assembled project can be seen in
Figure 35.

Figure 35. Fully assembled experiment on top of one of the HVAC tables.
As mentioned above, the acrylic housing was assembled first. The finished acrylic pieces were inserted into their
correct locations and fit was double checked. The team used a standard acrylic epoxy bought off Amazon to bond
the acrylic together but found that the strength of the epoxy was not enough. The team then resorted to using
Loctite silicone aquarium sealant which proved to be sufficient. At the same time, the ramp support was bonded
with JB Weld to the baseplate so that the acrylic ramp could be epoxied to the back wall of the housing. The housing
was then clamped and allowed to set for the required time.
Following the completion of the housing, the team proceeded to assemble the drivetrain and mass pulley subsystems.
These two subsystems were done in conjunction since the winch was needed to correctly align the large gear and
driveshaft. With the winch bolted down to act as a guide, the large gear bushing supports were located in the
baseplate so that the large gear could fully engage with the gear on the winch. These supports were bonded to the
baseplate with JB Weld. After allowing the JB Weld set, the team discovered that the supports had shifted slightly
which caused the driveshaft to seize. To fix this, the team removed the shaft and cleared out some material from
the bushings using a Dremel. Once the alignment problem was verified to be fixed, the pulley bushing support was
aligned with the other supports and welded onto the baseplate. The team had difficulty placing the pump pulley
onto the shaft due to its sheer size and its location on the shaft. As a result, an additional hole was drilled into the
outer housing so that assembly could be completed.
The pump system was assembled by caulking the inner pump walls to the baseplate. Additional aquarium epoxy
was added to the acrylic walls to ensure that the entire section was water tight. The small pump pulley was attached
to the pump shaft by torquing the setscrew in place. The inside of the pump was sprayed with Flex Seal water
sealant so that water would not be able to seep into the 3D printed layers. The casing of the pump was then
bonded with the Loctite sealant to itself and to the baseplate. Similarly, the impeller was bonded with the pump
shaft using the Loctite. Unfortunately, during the curing process, the pump and pump shaft shifted which caused
the shaft to seize. This problem was unable to be fixed since the housing limited the space available to do any
further manufacturing. Along with the pump shaft problems, the team had a lot of difficulty fusing the v-belt that
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 40 -

transfered energy from the large pump pulley on the driveshaft to the small pump pulley on the pump shaft. The
team attempted to follow the recommended procedure of heating, or melting, the belt together but that method
was unable to provide a strong bond. As a result, the team tried to use Gorilla brand super glue to bond the belt
which proved to be more effective than heating. However, the team found that the super glue failed to hold when
the pulleys were rotated. The v-belt was super glued to the large pump pulley itself which turned out to work well
in comparison to the other methods but its strength was unable to be fully tested. Due to time constraints, the team
deemed the pump subsystem to be unusable for testing.
The cart subsystem was the last subsystem to be assembled since it was the easiest of all. The first step of the
assembly required the two small cart pulleys to be bolted down, one to the baseplate and one to the ramp. Then the
cart track was super glued onto the ramp. Finally, the rope was strung through the pulley system and tied to the
cart.
After fully assembling the experiment the team reflected on ways to make the assembly process easier for the future.
It was concluded that placing the housing on first hurt the ability to adjust for problems that arose in the other
subsystems. This problem could have been avoided if the slots were CNC’d, but they were not and the procedure
was believed to work just as well. If the slots were to be waterjet again, the team would recommend to assemble the
drivetrain and pump system (including the two inner pump walls) first so that more space is available to work on
any issues. The acrylic could then be assembled afterward since they only affect the timing of assembling the ramp.

8. Testing and Validation
Due to the complications faced in the manufacturing stage and a lack of time, tests were not actually able to
be performed on the experiment. However, a testing plan was made that details the steps required to test the
experiment. The testing plan can be found in Attachment K. Most of the testing procedures that were planned to be
performed would have to be iterated many times to get a consistent set of data that could have been replicated by
the students. These tests would check each subsystem and the durability of their components.
The main component that the team wanted to test was the mass-pulley system that produces the input power to
run each subsystem. This system was to be tested so that the calculated values of rpm correlate with the values that
are read from the digital tachometer. The predicted values of rpm would be calculated using equation 10. The team
did not expect these values to exactly match but they should at least be on the same order of magnitude. The other
calculation that needed to be verified would be the time of the fall, which can easily be done with a stopwatch. A
final mass range would have been decided through extensive and repetitive falling mass tests. The lowest mass
of that range will be equal to the minimum mass required to power all three subsystems. At the opposite end of
the spectrum, the value for the maximum mass is dependent on the maximum height of the cart and pump head.
Additionally, various safety measures will have to be taken into account as well as it’s overall compatibility with the
system. These safety measures would include making sure the mass itself didn’t topple over the whole experiment,
or break off of the attachment rope. The other safety measure to best tested out would have been to make sure the
fall weight does not fall on students toes as it falls, or possibly swing around and hit them in the legs.
As mentioned in the potential energy conversion subsection, testing will have to be done to determine the weight
of the cart. In order to do so, the cart will start with no mass and the experiment will be run for dropped masses
ranging from 1 to 10 lbs. If the mass of the cart is too low, it will then be increased by .5 lb increments until a usable
range of heights for all dropped masses is found. It is important to note that the mass of the cart will also decrease
or increase depending on the usable range for the pump. The heights produced for the ideal cart mass will then be
tabulated and graphed for the ME 128 professors to reference.
Testing would have also been done on the pump subsystem to validate the head height calculations since the losses
were assumed. This testing will be done in a similar manner as the previous tests mentioned. The head height will
be determined by dropping the initial mass and recording how much head is produced. Since the pump is the most
difficult component to change, it will have the most influence on the usable operation range for the experiment.
Again, the head heights will be tabulated and graphed for the ideal input mass range for professors to reference.
Once subsystem testing is completed, the entire experimental procedure will be validated through simulated classroom
trials. The team will run the experiment first to ensure that the students will have all the necessary equations and
equipment to obtain consistent data. If the experiment performs satisfactorily, testing will move to student trials,
using several sample groups to again run the full experiment. Any feedback will be recorded and taken into account
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 41 -

if modifications are required. Finally, the experiment will be tested by the faculty who will be teaching ME 128
regularly. Again, feedback will be recorded and modifications will be completed if necessary.
A set of preliminary tests should have been conducted with a possibly prototype to see if all the components would
be able to be assembled as designed and if they would have given the results that were hoped for. The V belt should
have been tested for strength before assembly, as it ended up breaking with student interface.

9. Cost Analysis
Part sourcing for this project was done with the idea that multiple experiments would be constructed in the years
to come. The team also sourced the parts that would result in the cheapest overall costs, which include shipping.
Item were ordered from a few large suppliers who have a history of lower shipping costs on bulkier orders.
It must be noted that our final cost is just under $800. This is due to several one-off purchases not required for
reproduction, and also due to the fact that producing a prototype of a product is costlier than a production run.
It was thought that cheaper parts could be sourced to (such as those with educational deals), the total cost per
unit may still fall above the specified $500 limit. However, no deals were found and with the cost remained above
the $500 limit. Since these parts were no obtained from education resources due to the nature of the component
no such educational deals or affiliation with the university could have helped in any sort of price reduction. It is
because of this we are recommending all units be partially sponsored by MESFAC, the ME department student
allocation committee. Their mission is to fund any purchase that enhances ME student learning here at Cal Poly,
and this project provides learning for students from multiple aspects. Freshmen are handling the experimental part
of the project, and upperclassmen shop techs are manufacturing the units, gaining experience in machining and
fabricating processes. It is because of this that the team believes MESFAC will have no issue sponsoring a portion
of these units, keeping the out-of-pocket costs under $500 per unit for the ME department. Preliminary discussions
with the current 2016-2017 committee reflected this view. It was found to be quite easy to obtain MESFAC funds,
since the experiment did not require an large amount of money compared to other projects the team was able to
get a total of $360 in MESFAC funds. The committee was able to see the importance of a new experiment in the
curriculum and the benefit it would have for anyone involved in the department.
9.1

Bill of Materials

The bill of materials for this project, including cost and weights, is included in Attachment F. The final assembly
weighs a total of 14.75 lbs, which is light enough for a normal person to lift and store in the closet of the room. This
weight does not include the volume of water that would have been added to the system, but this weight will be
small since the height required and the tank dimensions only require a small amount of water to be used.
9.2

Ordering

All parts were ordered online once the design was approved. All parts arrived on campus between a day and a
week from ordering, based on traditional turn around times from the sources picked. Some parts were ordered later
than others to either try and find cheapest alternatives or the team was still contemplating the need for the material
piece in the experiment. The most expensive shipping item was the lead fishing weights, however this particular
vendor was chosen as they were the only vendor that did not sell these weights in bulk, but if bulk ordered of
weights are bought they can be obtained from a vendor with a lower shipping cost.
9.3

Final Order Specs

The following table below shows what was eventually ordered and used in the final assembly. Most of the costs
were covered by the alloted budget but other external, larger one off purchase were bought with MESFAC funds.
Further details can be seen in Attachment G for more information on the budget.
Doing further analysis on these costs it was found that 76.9% of the project could be paid for using the alloted funds
and 23.1% of the project was paid for using MESFAC funds. The majority of the cost come from the sheet orders,
however if ordered in bulk the price per sheet can be reduced to possibly fit with the budget. Another way that

- 42 -

the total cost of production could be reduced would have been with CNCing the baseplate in the machine shops
which could have been easily done by shop techs during the summer. This can prove for a simpler assembly the
acrylic walls and aluminum parts with simpler methods can prove to be cost effective. Considering how fast all
the material came and from accessible sources, it is entirely possible and simple for someone else to place an order.
Hyperlinks to all materials and products used can also be found in the bill of materials

10. Design and Manufacturing Improvements and Recommendations
With the combination of over budget spending, difficulties in manufacturing, and non-operational status of the
prototype, it can be quickly established that the concept for this project needs some improvements. The major
constraint was the scope of the project with respect to the budget. For $500, it was very difficult to complete a device
that covered all of the customer requirements. This was the main factor that led to the project’s complications. If
this project is to be attempted again, this issue can be resolved using the following recommendations.
One major flaw in the design was the pursuit of an all-in-one device that students could observe. Creating a single
unit allowed for a large stack-up in design relationships, compatibilities, and tolerances. While a single unit would
make an instructor’s and student’s time easier during lab time, the manufacturing and maintenance of a single unit
that provides examples of thermodynamics, fluids, and heat transfer principles is overwhelmingly complex for the
scope of the device. Even though we split the heat transfer demonstration up from the main unit, the complexity of
the mechanism provided us with enough issues that we excluded the heat transfer apparatus from the deliverables.
Splitting the current design into two or three separate modules would ease the complexity of the experiment setup.
For example, the thermodynamics experiment could be fragmented into a single module that students could power
with via a crank. Another module would demonstrate fluid flow through a pipe, and another would demonstrate
heat to mechanical energy transfer. By splitting up the concepts, small frames of 8020 or similar could be used to
simplify construction and reduce cost from buying raw materials. Since a stock winch is no longer being used,
plastic gearing can be used all around. Each sub-frame would only require 3-4 components to be attached to the
rails, and would be wholly contained inside themselves, allowing for simple storage.

California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 43 -

Figure 36. One concept that utilizes the modular experimental setup, demonstrating only fluid energy transfer
through a pump using a drill-driven pump and a small custom made turbine. This is essentially what the pump
side of the project design covered, but broken out to create an easier to make assembly. Small experimental
stations like these would be made for the other forms of energy conversion.
Another option is to continue to use the concepts in the current design, but reduce the scope of both the data
acquisition and relations to current industry energy problems and solutions. This concept, seen in Figure 36, is
based off of a similar project done in ME 443, Turbomachinery. This design would, again, allow us to utilize more
stock parts without the use of a restrictive stock input. Instead of printing a pump, this design would allow for use
of a stock input and output pump/turbine combination. The open-aired design would allow for easy storage
and maintenance of the fluid containment system. Additionally, the compact design would again allow for a
self-contained design. Students would take data on digital tachometers and voltmeters, essentially simulating a
hydroelectric dam. Power is inputted via a hand-powered drill, making recharging and replacing easy.
While being highly interactive and educationally engaging, the data collection (which was a major customer requirement)
in the aforementioned experiments is fairly sparse. To remedy this, students could also use more passive experimental
devices, such as our original Joule House concept. While definitely less stimulating than a more visually appealing
project, the data collection would be much more extensive. Students would be able to collect multiple data points
in varying conditions, and would be able to practice basic statistical analysis which they could comment on in their
memorandums. Maintenance and manufacturing would be minimal, as there are no moving parts and setup is
largely reliant on sensor calibration. However, as mentioned before, this experiment would be largely uninteresting
to incoming freshmen and may detract from the overall lab experience in a similar fashion to the current spring lab.
These concepts are brief design iterations that may or may not be pursued in the future. In general, however, the
following general notes should be taken into account:
• Reduce the scale of the experiment in terms of energy used and footprint (for self-sustainability and storage).
• Partition each concept covered into its own station within the lab environment.
• Ensure all devices in the lab have something physical students can observe. This can be as simple as a
pinwheel fan and as complex as a rotating flywheel.
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

- 44 -

• Formulate calculations that can be done by incoming freshmen students and that include direct relationships
between one another.
• Generate lab experiments that can be loosely tied back to a general mechanical component or assembly. The
connection can be very loose, but it must allow students to make connections they can branch off of.
• Specify separate budgets for the prototyping and mass-production of the experiments, to allow the project
team some leeway to test various types of subsystems.
• Unique manufacturing techniques must be accessible to the shop techs and must also be accessible by the
project team members.

11. Conclusion
This project concept has great promise, and can be done. The design pursued in this iteration was overly complex
in an attempt to capture the attention of the students and encapsulate all of the topics desired. As a result, the final
product suffered from delayed manufacturing timelines, reliances, and quick-fixes resulting in a finished product
that strayed too far from the original design.
We recommend that this project be pursued again, with the lessons learned from this experiment. The refined scope
and better idea of budgeting gathered from this project would greatly benefit any future iterations, and would
reduce the time used during the PDR and CDR phases where formation of just the general experimental concept
and lab execution was developed.
While the final device was largely unsuccessful, the research and design development done in the first phases of
the project offer valuable information for anybody pursuing a project similar to this, and we hope that it will be of
use to all who read this paper,

Energy Conversion and
Heat Transfer

California Polytechnic State
University, San Luis Obispo
Mechanical Engineering
Updated 2017

Introduction
The transfer of energy through multiple domains is a critical part of mechanical
engineering. We use various ways of manipulating energy to power systems,
change the state of a design, or move from one point to another.
As you already know, energy is always transferred from one component to another,
and never created. This can be through a belt, lever, piston, fluid, gas, and many
other objects. In mechanical engineering the study of energy transfer is largely
divided into three areas: mechanical energy, fluid energy, and heat transfer. These
three areas cross over each other in many ways, however they also act as standalone
areas of expertise for many mechanical engineers.
This transfer is never an ideal, and engineers must account for this in their designs.
Whether it is a car drive train, a wind or wave turbine, or a piezoelectric mechanism,
energy is constantly dissipated by other elements of a system or the environment
surrounding it. As a mechanical engineer, you must understand how these losses
form and how to calculate and quantify them. This is important in understanding
how energy behaves in a system, and must be communicated to a customer as
precisely as possible to allow for proper and ethical engineering.
In the development of clean energy, the losses seen by electrical systems are
becoming more and more important. Clever methods of energy storage and
generation are constantly being developed, however transfer of this energy to
the national grid can result in unfavorable returns if the system is inefficient or
designed poorly.
One example of this is the water-powered car, where hydrogen gathered from
water molecules is used to power a hydrogen-combustion engine to power a
vehicle. This concept is flawed in that it requires more energy to break apart
the molecules of water than it produces as horsepower to the tires. Ideally this
system may produce enough raw energy to balance the energy used to break the
hydrogen out, but the dissipation from the motor, gearbox, drive shaft, and tires
is enough to make this concept unusable with current technology.
Wind powered turbines are one of the most efficient methods to generate power,
but are power-limited in that the wind can only spin the turbine blades so fast
before the generator begins to resist any faster rotation. To overcome this issue,
engineers installed gearboxes and elevated the turbines. This allowed the system
to generate higher torque within the generator, and at a higher speed, creating
more electricity than before. In this case, engineers used an intermediate system
to overcome an energy limit.
This experiment has some basic systems that do not necessarily represent a single
device, but rather generalize many systems seen in industries across the field
of engineering. The following are relationships you may wish to draw while
running this experiment:

-1-

Mass-Pulley Subsystems
This subsystem, which consists of a large mass being dropped from a height,
represents every any form of potential to kinetic energy storage and generation.
Potential energy storage is commonly used on a large scale in hydroelectric systems,
where fluids can be stored in reservoirs to supplement energy demands. Elevators
utilize weights to balance the energy usage during travel, where a counterweight
changes the effective weight of the elevator car. In our case, the main subsystem
the weight turns a pulley which can power other systems. This is the source of
the system. There is also a massive cart on a track that can be pulled or dropped
on its incline as dictated by the tension of the rope and pulley it is attached to.
This acts a a coupled system to the dropped mass.
Geartrain
Geartrains are used in many different applications to reduce speed or increase
torque. One you may instantly recall is the gearbox in a car. This geartrain
converts the torque-limited high engine speed into a lower speed but higher
torque wheel output. All servo motors have a built-in gearbox that produces
a much higher shaft torque than the voltage would normally allow, making most
robotic and electric motion possible. As mentioned before, wind turbines use
a gearbox to reduce the torque requirement seen by the fan blades to turn the
generator. In our system, the geartrain drives a shaft that provides power to other
rotary elements: a v-belt, a generator, and another winch pulley. The geartrain
is important in that it transfers energy from the mass-pulley to the other systems
in 3D space, however due to its inertia, friction between systems, and tolerances
between parts there is a significant amount of energy lost in the transfer process.
This is what we will investigate today.
Pump
Fluid has been used to generate energy since the dawn of time. Waterwheels
have powered rotational systems to grind, saw, and machine various substances.
Pumps have allowed us to move fluids to locations and heights once impossible
in short amounts of time. One easy way to characterize a pump’s performance,
besides horsepower measurements, is to measure the height the pump can move
fluid straight up. This height is typically called a pump head. In essence, this
measurement is equivalent to a maximum pressure the pump can output, but in
a form that allows the user to understand their maximum elevation for a fluid
system. Like other rotary systems, pumps fall ill to friction losses in the shaft, the
pump blades, and the pipe flow along the walls. We will attempt to calibrate the
pump in our experiment to create a specification sheet for interested parties.

Procedure
This lab involves the collection of data as a group in order to write a formal
engineering report. Each student must participate in measuring and calculating
the energy transfered from each subsystem.
I. Potential to Rotational Energy
Mass released from a height will transform its potential energy into kinetic energy.
In the case of the experimental apparatus, this energy is also converted into
energy stored by rotational inertia by the rope.
1. Using the lever on the ramp side of, push the shifting mechanism inwards
to engage the large pulley (you can visibly check to see if the teeth are
engaging). This will run the system in the pump mode, which is safer to
run than the ramp since it does not have a hard stop.
2. Choose a mass or combination of masses that you think will provide enough
energy to overcome stiction (stationary friction within the system) and start
the gearing system. Record this mass.
3. Attach the masses via the carabiner(s) at the end of the winch rope and place
them on the surface of the table. Do not drop the masses until the system is set
up.
4. Ensure the Hall sensor is on and drop the masses. Record the fall time
and the max RPM readout on the Hall sensor. WARNING: Do not stand
directly underneath the pulley, and mind your toes as the mass drops.
5. If the masses do not fall, increase the amount of mass until stiction is overcome.
6. Once you mind a minimum mass required, repeat steps 3-4 with at least
two more masses.
Energy can be calculated for both sides of the system using the appropriate equations
found in the Reference Information section. You will compare these values in
your report.
II. Rotational Energy to Pump Head
1. In a fashion similar to Part I, set up the machine to transfer power to the
pump. If you are moving on directly from Part I this should already be
done.
2. Begin dropping the same masses you used from Part I and measure the
maximum pump head (the height the water reaches). Record these in your
table.

-3-

III. Rotational Energy to Potential Energy
1. Using the shifting knob, switch the gears around so power is transfered to
the cart ramp. Pull the lever out and rotate the shaft partially until the teeth
engage for the pulley-cart system.
2. Drop your lowest usable mass and record the height gain of the cart. Note
you will have to account for the slope of the ramp when you do your energy
calculations.
IV. Comparison to a Thermal System
1. Your instructor will demonstrate an alcohol engine and measure the flywheel
RPM. Be sure to record this for comparison in your memo.

Report Requirements
Your team will turn in your results and calculations in a formal engineering
report. The formatting and presentation of data in this report is important. It
communicates to the person reading the report what your findings were, and
how they can replicate the experiments if they so desire.
The report format and guidelines will be provided by your instructor. Use your
data and the relationships presented in the introduction to generate the requested
results.
