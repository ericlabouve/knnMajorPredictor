Introduction and Deliverable
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a role playing game released by Bethesda Softworks in 2011 that
has received numerous accolades, awards, and an aggregate review score of 94/100i. It's known for its
massive real-time world with numerous characters to engage with, locales to explore, and stories to
uncover and affect, but has also been criticized by professional game reviewers and gamers alike for its
awkwardii and unengagingiii combat. The aim of this project was to modify Skyrim's combat system to
be an enjoyable and engaging part of the game, as opposed to an element that drags it down as a whole.
Compared to other role playing games, Skyrim's combat system falls flat, lacking the depth of semi
turn-based games like Bioware's Dragon Age: Origins or the precision of From Software's Dark Souls.
This is in large part because the structure of Bethesda's Elder Scrolls and Fallout role playing games are
very different from these examples, so much so that they're considered to be in their own subgenre of
role playing game. This difference in structure means that Bethesda cannot easily pull elements from
games like Dark Souls or Dragon Age: Origins. It doesn't have a party system where you issue series
of commands to manage multiple characters, like in Dragon Age: Origins, and the game wasn't
designed with constant player deaths in mind like Dark Souls was, so a combat system like Dark
Souls's that forces the player to learn the details of how their weapon works or die trying would be
much more punishing, as players could lose significant amounts of progress for a small lapse in
concentration. However, looking at Dragon Age: Origins and Dark Souls, it became clear that one of
the biggest common threads they had that Skyrim lacked were consequences for the player's resource
management. Both Dragon Age: Origins and Dark Souls have negative consequences for players
wasting their resources, usually in the form of needing to reload the game or restart an area, and
positive ones for optimizing them, which is a design concept that could be implemented into Skyrim.
My solution was to add consequences that were slightly less severe than Dragon Age: Origins's or Dark
Souls's, which I did by reworking how Skyrim's "stamina" statistic, which measures the character's
1

physical fatigue, is utilized in combat. Previously stamina was only consumed when characters
performed a special "power attack," which is an attack with a wind-up that deals more damage, or
when they "sprinted," after which stamina would slowly regenerate. In my project, stamina was
changed so that every swing of a weapon consumes stamina, and so that when a character drops to zero
or less stamina as a result of a weapon swing, they have a high chance of dropping their weapon on the
floor, significantly setting them back in combat. Additionally, trying to sprint and running out of
stamina causes that character to trip. These new mechanics have been applied to the player and to all
the characters the player encounters, forcing players to carefully manage their attacks and movement to
avoid falling into a disadvantage in combat, but also giving them an opportunity to manipulate the
mechanics to give themselves the edge. Players can't treat combat like a mindless exercise in clicking
because doing so will leave them unarmed and scrambling to stabilize. Needing to gauge how much
stamina they have forces the player to engage with the combat, and makes it feel less like a thoughtless
chore and more like an activity that requires strategic thought.

Literature and Technology Review and Technology Overview
Before starting this project, I did research to see if there were any other modifications, also
referred to as "mods," that were created with similar goals in mind. From research I found that there
were two primary sources for mods, the Steam Workshop, which is part of the same software platform
Skyrim is on, so all Skyrim players have easy access to it, and the Skyrim Nexus Mods site, which has
retained popularity in part due to its history hosting mods for other Bethesda role playing games,
including The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout:
New Vegas. This information was gathered by reviewing forums used for discussion of Skyrim, some
of the largest being the Skyrim Subredditiv, the Skyrim GameFAQs pagev, The Nexus Forumsvi, and
TES Alliancevii. I found several mods that tried to address the same problem, but none that did so in
2

the same way that I did, and all to seeming various degrees of success. Some of the most prominent
mods that attempted to do so were DUEL- Combat Realismviii, which adjusts the artificial intelligence
of the game's characters, makes timing blocks and attacks more important, makes more player actions
consume stamina, and substantially increases damage taken, Ultimate Combatix, which gives enemies
more combat abilities, emphasizes blocks and timing, implements changes to the artificial intelligence
of the game's characters, and makes weapon swings cost stamina, and Deadly Combatx, which largely
focuses on adjustable values to modify how much damage players and enemies take by modifying the
effectiveness of armor and weapons. While these are quite popular mods, none of them are universally
accepted by the community as an improvement or a fix to Skyrim's combat, and none of them utilize
the consequences that I came up with. Because there was nothing that seemed to implement the ideas I
had, I did further research on the best tools for the modification of Skyrim. Using the same sites I did
to find the most popular sources for mods, I did research on tools that could be used to mod Skyrim.
Through my research, the primary tool that seemed to be in use was the Creation Kit, a modified
version of the software used to make Skyrim that was released by the game's developers to the
community for free use. Further research showed that the Creation Kit used a proprietary scripting
language called papyrus. I also found another resource, the Skyrim Script Extender, which acted as a
free function library for papyrus. Throughout the course of my project, I used the same sources'
modding subforums to find answers to questions I had about how the Creation Kit, papyrus, and the
Skyrim Script Extender worked, and through them I also found the Creation Kit Wikixi, a wiki site
dedicated to the tools used in the Creation Kit, which was a significant reference for methods in
papyrus, and which also provided substantial tutorials that helped me create the skeleton for my own
mod.

Design and Implementation
From my research, I knew that the Creation Kit was the most versatile and well documented
way to add to or modify Skyrim, so my first thought was to look into using the Creation Kit to directly
add code that would run alongside the rest of the game, forcing all characters to operate by my new
rules, but after some investigation, I found out that the Creation Kit doesn’t support the direct addition
of code to the game. I then did additional investigation to see if there was a way to apply new code to
all characters in the game, as this would still force characters to act by my new rules. While there was
no way to apply code to all characters other than manually applying it to them one at a time, a few of
the sources I used recommended a workaround that would apply the code to all relevant characters
dynamically. This workaround utilized the Creation Kit’s magic system. Magic is organized by the
“Magic Effect”, which is what the magic does to whatever target it is applied to, and the “Spell,” which
acts as a delivery mechanism for the magic effect. My mod uses several spells and magic effects to
make its changes, the first spell being “cloak”, which targets all characters within a specified range of
the character who casts the spell. I made a magic effect to be applied by the cloak Spell that forces all
characters under its effects to cast a second spell. This second spell targets the caster, which in this
case is every character who is hit by the first spell. The magic effect for the second spell forces
characters to continually cast a third spell on themselves. The magic effect corresponding to the third
spell applies the codexii that I’ve written to all characters targeted by the spell. The player character is
forced to always cast the first spell (with no sound or animations), causing all characters within range
to cast the second spell on themselves, which then forces them to cast the third spell on themselves.
effectively applying the new rules I’ve made to everyone within combat range of the player character.
The player character is also forced to cast the second spell, so that the player is also forced to abide by
the new rules. These spells were heavily based off the guide Dynamically Attaching Scriptsxiii,
specifically the subsection Applying Scripts to Actors. The new rules force characters to lose stamina
4

every time they swing their weapon, with the amount of stamina lost tied to the weight of their weapon,
and whenever a character’s stamina drops to zero, a random number between one and ten is generated,
and if the character’s skill in using that weapon divided by fifteen plus one is less than the randomly
generated number, they drop the weapon they swung in front of them. If one plus their skill over
fifteen is greater than or equal to the randomly generated number, the character holds on to the weapon
they swung. The script detects when a weapon is swung by constantly checking to see when the
character performs a weapon swing animation, and when they do it runs a check to see if this caused
the character’s stamina to drop to zero. The code also implements a check to see what kind of weapon
the character is using, so that it knows which skill to use. The Skyrim Script Extender was introduced
at this point, as the basic papyrus library of functions doesn't offer a straightforward way to check what
weapon the player is using, but the Skyrim Script Extender's expanded function library did. My mod
makes its changes to sprinting by constantly checking to see if the character is sprinting, and if they are
if their stamina is at zero. If it is, then the character is knocked down and set to "Ragdoll." Ragdolling
is when a character falls to the ground like a normal object would, so when they trip they fall and then
have to wait a few seconds to get up. This mod also makes sprinting cost significantly more stamina to
reflect the advantage movement gives in combat, and makes stamina regenerate significantly faster, as
leaving the stamina regeneration rate at the game’s base level forced players to hang back for
significant periods of time waiting for their stamina to regenerate, which is not a very entertaining
experience. This allowed me to implement the changes I wanted to.

Analysis and Verification of Success
Early testing of the mod was conducted on my personal laptop and was overseen by me. A total
of five people participated in testing, which consisted of playing a level one character set immediately
before the Bleak Falls Barrow dungeon, being asked to progress as far as they could in the dungeon in
5

fifteen minutes, and taking a short anonymous questionnairexiv after they had finished playing. I chose
to use a level one character so that players had a blank slate to work with, and didn’t feel forced into a
playstyle that took advantage of a leveled up character. Bleak Falls Barrow was chosen because it’s an
early dungeon that most Skyrim players will have already gone through in their own playing
experience because of its importance in the game's early story, because it is designed to be accessible
for low level characters, and because it presents a fair amount of enemy variety in the form of bandits,
undead, spiders, and animals, so players would have to vary their strategy based on which kind of
enemy they were fighting. The questionnaire indicated that two of the five testers had no prior
experience playing Skyrim, that one had between 40 and 100 hours of experience, that another had
between 100 and 200 hours of experience, and that another had over 200 hours of experience. The
testing session was structured with the expectation that players already had at least some background
with Skyrim, and as a result the two testers with no prior experience were unable to comment on how
they felt the mod affected the game, as they had no basis for comparison. Questions were asked on a
one to ten scale, with ten being yes, one being no, and five being neutral. The three testers with prior
Skyrim answered the question "Did the mod make combat feel more engaging than the original game's
combat," with an eight, an eight, and a nine, indicating that the mod was a success in term of getting
the player more engaged. When asked "Did the mod make combat feel more fun than the original
game's combat?" testers responded with a five, an eight, and a seven, indicating that testers mostly had
more fun, and at the very least did not have less fun. There were a few issues encountered in the
testing session, namely that certain weapons were heavy enough that one swing of them could drop a
player’s stamina to zero, which indicates that the cost per swing may be too high, as players only had
access to starting weapons, and while gating access to heavier weapons based on stamina later in the
game is certainly an interesting idea, players should be able to use the full suite of starting level gear
from level one, as they are often still feeling out what kind of character they would like to play, and
6

should be able to use the starting set of weapons to experiment without too dire of consequences.
Another tester commented that they don’t think they saw an enemy drop a weapon. While bandits have
been tested and confirmed to drop their weapons when appropriate, additional tests may be conducted
on the "Draugr" enemies, as they may not be affected by the mod the same way that human characters
are. The testers had differing opinions on the combat, with some claiming additional difficulty, and
some claiming that the difficulty was about the same. These tests indicate that the changes made do
make combat more engaging and overall generally more enjoyable, which was the primary purpose of
this project. Further testing is still needed, but current results are positive.

Future Work
Testing also outlined several elements that will be of interest for future work. The most
important of which is to properly balance the weights of weapons to make sure that the stamina costs
make sense with the weapon in question, but there are also several UI elements that I intend to
incorporate. One of these is a notification that a weapon may be dropped from a single attack (or
power attack) when the player is at full stamina, another is recognizing when a player has "favorited" a
weapon, so that if dropped, when it is retrieved it goes back into the favorited category instead of
requiring the player to re-favorite it whenever they drop it. Another future change is to incorporate a
mechanic that points players to where their dropped weapons are, so they don't have to search all over
the map to find them after a fight. In the further future, I intend to look into additional changes, like
items or spells that make it harder to drop weapons or trip when sprinting, and re-balancing of items
that damage fatigue, which with the changes I've made are much more powerful than they were in the
base game. I'd also like to create custom animations for weapon drops and sprinting trips, which
should enhance player immersion and make what's happening more clear for players who are
unfamiliar with my mod and the changes it makes.

Societal Impacts
The primary implications my project has are largely related to the subgenre of Bethesda role
playing games, but the general finding that the lack of consequence is what causes lack of engagement
could be applied to a much wider spread of games. Additional Bethesda role playing games (whether
or not they are actually published by Bethesda) can implement the changes I made in any title that
utilizes the mechanics that my changes rely on, stamina, weapon swings, and sprinting, to create a more
engaging experience, which should mean that players will feel less like they have to force themselves
through the combat to enjoy the rest of the experience, and hopefully will view it as another positive
element the game has to offer. Other games that rely on mechanics players find unsatisfying may also
benefit from incorporating more consequences into gameplay, making players more willing to play not
only with those mechanics, but to see the other aspects of the game as well.

Conclusion
This project was created with the intent of making the melee combat of The Elder Scrolls V:
Skyrim engaging and enjoyable. I started by looking at other games in different role playing game
subgenres, and identified that an element they had in common that Skyrim lacked were significant
consequences for player actions in combat. With some brainstorming, I thought of the idea of
modifying the way the stamina statistic worked as a way to implement these consequences. I then
followed up on this by doing research to see where mods for Skyrim could be found, if anyone had
made any mods to address the same issues I had, and if those mods were succesful. Upon finding that
no mods were accepted by the majority of the community as a solution to the problem, I looked into the
tools I would need to make my own mod, and did research into the Creation Kit and Skyrim Script
Extender. Once I started making the mod, I used various forums and the Creation Kit wiki to figure out
how to implement the changes I wanted to make. Once I had a working version, I did some
8

preliminary tests, which came back mostly positive and at worst neutral. From those tests I've been
able to identify several features I want to implement in the future, as well as find a few bugs I was not
aware of. The ideas behind this mod could go on to influence other games in the genre to incorporate
similar design ideologies, and potentially make them more enjoyable games for it. Incorporating
consequences into Skyrim will make the game a better experience by making the combat more
engaging and enjoyable, and by extension making the rest of what the game has to offer be more
accessible.
