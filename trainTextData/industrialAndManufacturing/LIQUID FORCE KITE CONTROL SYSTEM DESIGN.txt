ABSTRACT
Liquid Force Kite Control System Design
Brendan Kerr, Alden Simmer, Brodie Sutherland
Kiteboarding is an ocean sport wherein the participant, also known as a kiter, uses a large
inflatable bow shaped kite to plane across the ocean on a surfboard or wakeboard. The
rider is connected to his or her kite via a control bar system. This control system allows
the kiter to steer the kite and add or remove power from the kite, in order to change
direction and increase or decrease speed. This senior project focused on creating a new
control bar system to replace a control bar system manufactured by a kiteboarding
company, Liquid Force. The current Liquid Force control bar has two main faults,
extraneous components and a lack of ergonomic design. Our team aimed to eliminate
unneeded components and create a more ergonomic bar. By eliminating components, the
bar would also be more cost effective to produce by using less material and requiring less
time to manufacture.
We first conducted a literature review into the areas of kiteboarding control systems and
handle ergonomics. Based on studies done on optimal grip diameters for reducing
forearm stress we concluded that the diameter for the bar grip should be at least a
centimeter less than the maximum grip of the user. In addition to the literature review we
conducted our own ergonomics surveys on fellow kite surfers regarding their preference
towards the shape of the grip. Using ANOVA analysis, we found that riders preferred a
bar with a less square center, but no clear preference on an oval shape versus a circular
shape, so we decided on circular to minimize manufacturing and material costs. A
functional decomposition was then employed on the current bar and a QFD analysis of
each component was conducted. We found that 33% of the components composed the
plastic bar end swivel. We decided to remove the swivel system due to its lack of use and
ergonomics. We then began the design process on the new bar ends and bar center.
We went through two iterations of a smaller square center, choosing a center with
chamfered edges to blend with the grip material. Our bar end design went through four
iterations ranging from a simple angular boxy look, to a curved design which was more
aesthetically and ergonomically pleasing. With SolidWorks models in hand, Mastercam
toolpaths were built by our technical advisor, and we machined the bar ends and center
out of aluminum billet. For the grip tubing we used carbon fiber tubing. By the end of
manufacturing we had three different length bars to test in the ocean and we had reduced
the bar part count from 31 parts to 13 parts. To justify the bars we created in terms of
cost, we conducted economic comparisons between our bar design and the current bar.
We concluded that Liquid Force would save $26,105.87 per year in labor and materials
by switching to our bar and using casting processes for manufacturing.
Due to the economic advantage and the new ergonomic design, we feel that Liquid Force
should implement the design after further testing and refining. The bar performed without
fault in our ocean test session, but we did find that improvements could be made in terms
of grip ergonomics; the carbon surface was usable, but an EVA grip would give the user
a softer, less slippery surface to steer with. We recommend that more long term testing be
done to insure that the glue does not de-bond over time and that the carbon aluminum
ii

interface does not corrode. Continuing the project, we will research grip materials such as
EVA, and create over molded bar grips and bar end covers.

I. Introduction
This report will describe the design of a new control system for our sponsor, Liquid
Force Kiteboarding.
Kiteboarding is a water sport where the athlete is pulled across the water on a wakeboard
or surfboard via the power of a large kite, as seen in Figure 1, below. To control the kite a
rider uses a kite-bar/control system that that has four very strong lines to both steer and
adjust the power in the kite. By pulling the bar towards themselves, the rider can increase
the power in the kite. If the rider angles the bar this creates a difference in tension on the
lines connected to the wingtips of the kite which causes the kite to turn. The power of the
kite is dispersed over the riders body using a harness as seen in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Kiteboarding Diagram
Liquid Force Kiteboarding has been a leading brand in kiteboarding since 1999. They
provide a full range of kite related products including, kites, bars, boards, harnesses, and
a full line of both accessories and apparel.
Currently kiteboarding control systems are very expensive, ranging from $400 - $700.
These bars are filled with many overcomplicated features which often negatively affect
the durability and reliability of the bar. In some cases, these features result in safety
issues due to lack of ergonomic design. The current Liquid Force control system is made
up of 73 different components and takes 14.4 minutes per bar to assemble.
Our team’s goal was to develop a new bar that is contained fewer components, was more
ergonomic, and could be assembled and produced for a much lower cost. Our project
deliverables are as follows:
 Build a CAD design of an ergonomic bar with fewer components, and less
manufacturing/assembly steps. This bar design will be a result of research into
ergonomics, and manufacturing done by the team.
 Create manufacturing routings and production planning for prototype
manufacturing.
 Machine key components of the new design
 Assemble a working prototype of the bar.
 Test the bar on the water, this will require lines, and a safety system, which are
out of our design scope, to be used from previous Liquid Force bars.
 Perform an ergonomic comparison with our design.



Provide Liquid Force with a bill of materials, manufacturing routings, part, and
assembly drawings and a recommended assembly process for the bar.

To build a CAD design of the control system we must first have an understanding of
how kite-bars are manufactured. Extensive literature review into materials and
ergonomics, as well as researching other brands designs was our first step. Next, a
functional decomposition of the current Liquid Force “Response” bar was performed
to both further our knowledge of machining processes used in the construction, and to
set a benchmark to compare our design with. After the functional decomposition, a
QFD House of Quality was constructed to understand which design features are most
important and how they are related to other design aspects of the control system.
Once critical features of a control system were identified, an ergonomic experiment
and analysis was performed to determine preferred shapes and contours for the new
design. The next step was building an initial design using CAD software.
Once we had a design, our team consulted with our technical advisor and made
adjustments for manufacturing. An assembly model of the prototype was made. Once
all design work was complete production planning for the prototype began and our
team formulated manufacturing routings for all machined components on the bar.
Then with the help of our technical advisor we machined the prototype parts. Once
the parts were completed, an assembly routing was made and the prototype was put
together. Once manufacturing was complete on the prototype, Liquid Force lines and
safety system, which fall out of our design scope, were added to the bar so that it
could be tested on the water.
Finally, our team performed an economic analysis comparing the Response bar to our
new design. Machine time, assembly time and material cost were used to formulate
an estimated price, which is compare to Liquid Forces current cost on their bar at
production quantities. Estimations were made and recorded for any costs that our
team cannot source accurate data for.
II. Background
A kite bar allows a rider to control both the direction and power in their kite. The main
functions of a kite bar are:
 Connecting the kite to user by attaching the two front lines to a kiters harness.
 Steering the kite back and forth via pulling on either side of the bar.
 Adjusting power in the kite via pushing the bar away from you or pulling it
towards you, (this changes the length ratio between the front two lines and the
back two steering lines).
 Providing a safety system that allows the user to release the kite in case of
emergency.
There are many components of a kite bar that were researched for our literature review.
The core of the bar is usually made of metal, plastic, or carbon fiber. The bar undergoes
many different stresses while kiting and must be able to handle the abuse that a rider may
put on it. Kiteboarding also takes place in salt water. The salt water use required research
on how corrosion will affect the components of our control system. In addition to
designing for the elements, we also must design for user ergonomics, which include how
2

the bar feels in hand, how easy it is to grip and control, and how easily the rider can
visually understand the controls. There are many other companies that have already
designed kite control systems. It will be important for us to look at other existing design
and make sure we are not infringing on any other company’s patents. We also may be
able to get ideas from other designs that we can incorporate into our bar.
In the kiteboarding industry, it is common to release a new product every calendar year to
attract new consumers and "outdate" previous designs, encouraging consumers to
upgrade annually. This trend has pushed many kite companies to rush to add more
features to their bars, often with little testing, and a lack of regard to how much the
feature will affect the riders experience in a negative or positive way. Some of the
current trends in kite bar development are:
 Adjustable bar length.
 Swivels to reduce twisting of lines.
 Line trimming systems built into the bar/grip.
 Redesigned connection/safety systems to allow for more freedom of movement.
III. Literature Review
In order to validate our project in terms of its need, and to design the most optimal
product based on parameters of durability, simplicity, manufacturability, cost, and
comfort, a literature review was conducted. The literature review contained five main
areas of research: background research on designs from other kite companies, dangers
and safety in kiteboarding, grip and color ergonomics, materials selection, and
manufacturing processes. The first area we looked into was the existing kite bars and
what they offered in terms of our parameters. We searched through all of the prominent
kite company websites to look at designs and systems used for the control bar. We found
that the majority of bars used molded plastic ends with aluminum tubes and EVA grips.
We then looked at materials used in the bar paying specific attention to studies on
corrosion resistance. Aluminum is an optimum material for kite bars since it naturally
reacts very quickly with air to form a protective oxide film [9]. After looking at materials,
we looked into manufacturing processes for both metal parts and foam parts included in
the bar. In addition, we looked at design for manufacturing in order to reduce the cost of
the bar. Designing for assembly is mainly focused on simplifying the assembled bar by
reducing part count and designing the bar parts so that they are easy to assemble [11]. To
look at the part count and functionality derived from each part, we used a functional
decomposition method [15]. Our functional decomposition yielded 73 components the
bar assembly. In addition to these websites we searched for articles on dangers in
kiteboarding since safety is a concern in our design and kiteboarding is an extreme sport.
A paper on the most common traumas and injuries related to kitesurfing concluded that
most of the injuries experienced by riders are on their lower extremities and their lower
backs [1]. There are usually no lasting injuries that come directly from the bar, but there
are definitely crashes and injuries that arise from the misuse of the bar and isolated cases
of bar components causing minor lacerations to the users hands. To avoid lacerations and
user mistakes resulting in injury, we decided on a curved bar end design with no small
plastic parts that could cut the user.
We wanted to make our bar more user friendly, so we researched color coding for
usability [13], and the influence of handle diameter and foam thickness on rider comfort.
Although there were not any studies published about kiteboarding bar grips, studies have
3

been published on the diameters of tools used by workers in industrial settings. One study
focused on comparing three different handle diameters [5]. The first bar diameter
matched the inside grip diameter of the user. The second handle diameter was 1cm larger
than the users grip diameter, and the third handle diameter was 1cm smaller than the
users grip diameter. A user’s grip diameter can be measured by forming an O shape with
the pointer finger and the thumb [6]. The study concluded that a handle diameter 1cm less
than the users grip diameter increased the users grip strength, and decreased the use of the
users forearm muscles when compared to the larger diameters[6]. The current Liquid
Force bar is not perfectly circular; the width is actually larger than the height by
approximately a tenth of an inch. The rough diameter is around 1.1 inches which, when
looking at personal grip diameters, is a little over a centimeter smaller. To supplement
source [6], we conducted our own survey specific to kite bars and grip comfort which
will be presented in the design section. From this research we decided to use a diameter
of 0.875in with a grip thickness of 0.1in.
III. Design
The first step in our design process was to implement a functional decomposition by
dismantling the current bar and categorizing the functions of each component to
determine the usefulness of each one.

Figure 2: Functional Decomposition 1

In figure 2, the current control system is shown with the lines wrapped up for storage
(top) and with the lines unrolled as they would be for use (bottom left). The intact release
system is displayed as well, (bottom right). The release system attaches to the rider’s
4

harness that is worn around their waist. The bar is held by the rider and used to control
the kite. In the following figures, we took apart each of these components and examined
how they were made.

Figure 3: Functional Decomposition 2

In Figure 3 you can see the decomposition of the release system. This decomposition
revealed that the current release system is comprised of 15 different components, many of
which were molded plastic and held together with pins. The release works by sliding the
release handle away from yourself. Once the release is pulled, the chicken loop detaches
from one end and frees the rider for the bar. While disassembling the release system we
discovered that the current release is unserviceable due to the use of pins. We also found
that the swivel bearing was very difficult to remove and did not spin freely.

Figure 4: Functional Decomposition 3
5

Figure 4 shows the internals of the actual bar. The bar is made up of 2 center tubes, a
center aluminum piece and then molded EVA foam for grip and comfort. The EVA
coating is made up of 4 individual components, making the total part count for the bar
equal to 7. After examining the grip we believe it is put on using an over molding
process. There is no evidence of the grip being wrapped on.

Figure 5: Functional Decomposition 4

Figure 5 shows the bar ends broken down into individual components. This revealed that
although the bar ends were designed to swivel, there is friction in the rotating joint that
makes it very difficult to spin the bar end. The locking system for the end consists of two
tabs that click into slots in the leader line anchors. The swivel system was simply relying
on the elasticity of plastic in the bar end swivel lock to keep the end from rotating. This
system is prone to jams and breaks as the plastic ages. There was no way to disassemble
the bar end without physically breaking the end. The function of the bar end floats is to
keep the bar floating when the rider crashes their kite, as well as keep the lines away from
the rider. The bar end was made up of 24 components. Which accounts for 33% of the 73
components which make up the entire bar.
Appendix A consists of a list of every part of Liquid Force's current Response bar, as
well as a description of each part’s function. This parts list will act as a benchmark for
our team's design and allow us to design a part that has fewer components. By
performing the functional decomposition, we were able to determine the necessary
functions for our bar design and eliminate unnecessary components.
Next, we benchmarked other companies control bars. We wanted to draw inspiration
from other designs. We made an effort to look at the functions of as many companies
bars as possible. When evaluating the other designs we looked at what functions the other
bars had compared to our bar. Figure 6 shows the North Click Bar and the F-ONE bar.

Figure 6: Alternative bar designs Benchmarked
After looking at many different bars and their features, we felt we had a good background
to base our design on. Many of the bars were feature packed and overcomplicated. The
next step was to evaluate what features we felt were necessary in a kite bar and what
could be eliminated. To do this we used a Quality Function Deployment (QFD) matrix.
Appendix B shows our QFD matrix performed with bar functions and customer
specifications for quality. We had a group of six experienced kiteboarders go through the
matrix to rate attributes and then used the QFD matrix to relate those attributes to design
aspects. What we found was, the highest relatively weighted design aspects in order of
importance were: maximizing percentage of replaceable parts, reaching 100% depower in
the safety system, minimizing corrosiveness, smoothness of bar ends, and minimizing
cost.
For our design, we wanted to create a bar that met the design requirements attained from
our QFD. To do this our team used what we had learned from our literature review,
functional decomposition, and benchmarking other kite company’s bars, to design a
much simpler bar. The attributes we focused on most were, percentage of replaceable
parts, minimizing corrosiveness, smoothness of bar ends and minimizing costs. We
decided reaching 100% depower is out of our scope at the moment as we are currently
focusing on a bar that will work with their current safety system and lines.
After reviewing different materials from our literature review and looking at what other
companies are using for their bars, we decided to make our bar out of aluminum and
carbon. Aluminum forms an oxidized outside layer that inhibits corrosion. Many of the
other bars we looked at were constructed out of aluminum or stainless steel. Our plan was
to die cast the aluminum components in production, as we felt aluminum would be a
good fit to keep costs low compared to using stainless steel. Our components could also
be anodized to further inhibit corrosion and give the bar a unique look. Our initial design
for the core of our bar consists of five main pieces; one bar center, two bar ends, and two
tubes. The first CAD assembly is shown in Figure 7.

The center was designed to be comfortable to grip and aesthetically pleasing. The center
of the bar is a cast A356 aluminum piece as shown in Figures 8 and 9. It was designed to
be similar to the rest of the Liquid Force product line. The chamfers on the rectangular
section of the bar allow for a larger bonding surface for the grip of the bar. If the
chamfers are removed, sharper edges would be make the bar less ergonomic for the rider
to grip. The logo on the bar center is just on one side of the bar. When the rider crashes
and loses hold of the bar, the logo gives a visual cue to the rider on what side of the bar
they should grab. If the rider doesn't see the logo they know they are grabbing the wrong
side.
The design difference in the 1st and 2nd iteration bar centers is subtle but important. The
difference is shown in the transition from the round insert section to the square center. In
the first iteration, the transition contains a sharp edge whereas the second iteration has a
curved edge. Furthermore, this curved edge improves the design by giving the grip
material more surface area to bond to, and gives the user a more seamless transition feel
in their hands between the exposed aluminum and the grip material
The round section of the bar is a stock size piece of carbon tubing. We decided to go with
an off the shelf carbon tube to keep costs down. To determine the size of this tube we
used our research on grip diameters. We determined .10 inches was a good thickness for
our grip that goes over the tube. We sized our tube so that with our grip added the
diameter of the bar would match our desired value. We wanted to find a grip size that we
believe is best for the rider. This was also difficult because we wanted to use a stock tube
diameter. We ended up using a 0.875 inch diameter tube, which is comparable to existing
bar diameters and is approximately a centimeter less than the average user’s grip
diameter range.
The last component of the core of our bar is the bar ends. The function of the bar end is to
move the pivot point of the steering line away from the centerline of the bar to reduce the
roll produced by the tension in the outside lines. We wanted these ends to be lightweight
to reduce the swing weight of the bar. A light bar contributes to a more direct feel when
steering the kite. Reducing the weight of the ends of the bar has the biggest effect on this
steering feel. We decided to once again use aluminum for our bar ends. This gave us the
desired strength in the ends as well as a matching look to the bar center. In future designs
a plastic or over molded rubber version of our end could be used to reduce weight and the
chance of damaging the riders board. Figure 10 shows the cad model of our 1st iteration
bar end.

9

Figure 10: CAD model of 1st Iteration Bar End

Figure 11: CAD model of 2nd Iteration Bar End
We discovered that the first bar end did not offer us enough room to attach the foam
floats, (long foam pieces which keep the lines away from the bar to prevent wrapping), so
we decided to change the design to a slightly longer bar end with a tab at the top to attach
a steering line. We were not pleased with the aesthetics of the 2 nd iteration, shown in
Figure 11, and decided an end without a tab would better looking and less likely to fail
mechanically without the stress concentration point at the tab. Our design changes
resulted in our 3rd iteration in Figure 12 below

10

Figure 12: CAD model of 3rd Iteration Bar End
For this iteration of the bar end we went with a much smoother look. We felt this end was
nicer looking than the previous iterations, but didn’t match well with the look of our bar
center. We quickly revised this design and moved to our final iteration, shown in Figure
13 below. We used design for manufacturability in our 4th iteration by using standard
radii and feature sizes to accommodate tooling for the machining needed to make the
molds for the production model as well as the machining of the prototype. We wanted a
bar end that could be die cast in an inexpensive manner while also being good looking,
hence our final design.

Figure 13: CAD model of final Bar End
With iteration 4 we finally felt we had reached the look and function of the bar end we
desired. We felt this end matched well with the look of our rectangular center. The curve
in the end has been sized to fit lines around the end when the bar is wrapped up for
11

storage. The bar end has no sharp edges so the rider can't cut their hands while using the
bar. For our prototype, we machined this bar end out of 6061 aluminum whose properties
closely match the A356, which would be used in the final production parts. Machining
was the simplest way to produce a prototype of our design. In production this part would
be die cast. The initial overhead cost of the mold would be high, but the parts could be
produced very inexpensively with little waste. The finish of the parts would be sufficient
enough to anodize straight out of the mold. Finally, a portion of the bar end could be over
molded with rubber, reducing the amount of metal and creating a softer end that wouldn't
damage boards. With the design of this end we drastically reduced the number of
components in the bar end while keeping the key functions needed in a kite bar as
determined in our QFD.
In Appendix C, our ergonomic survey is shown. In this survey we blindfolded
kiteboarders, and had them hold 10 different production kiteboarding bars successively.
Each participant was asked to rate both the grip and the center piece of the bar separately
from 1- 10, 1 being a very poor fit to their hand, and 10 being a perfect fit to their hand.
This knowledge helped us build the most ergonomic grip possible. We also surveyed the
riders on which features they use on their bars. This resulted in determining that none of
the riders had ever used the adjustable length feature of their bar. We felt this was a
justifiable reason to eliminate this complicated and expensive feature in an effort to
reduce our part count and overall cost.

Figure 14: Bar Centers Minitab

In Figure 14 above shows the one-way ANOVA output from our ergonomic survey. The
comparison of the means gave us a P-value of 0.025, this means we can reject the null
hypothesis, h0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = μ4 and state with 95% confidence that the different bar
centers have unequal levels of comfort. The small circle and small square cross sections
had the highest values included in them, but large confidence intervals due to smaller
12

sample sizes. The large square clearly results in a lower mean. This shows in the P-values
as well with the only P-value below .005, we can state with 95% confidence that the large
square cross section results in the least amount of comfort for kiteboarders. For our bar
center we chose to use a smaller sized rounded square to avoid the discomfort of the large
square while keeping the modern looking shape of square center. Although ANOVA does
not rely heavily on normality, the clear normal distribution shown in Figure 15 helps
confirm and adds confidence to our results.

The ANOVA analysis for bar grips resulted with a P-value of .449 therefor failing to
reject the null hypothesis: h0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = μ4 . The bar grips were separated into three
categories, circular, taller than wide (by 0.1 in or greater) and wider than tall (by 0.1 in or
greater). As a team we cannot yet make a recommendation on grip shape ergonomics.
However, a circular grip would result in less material, allow us to use standard carbon
fiber tube, and allow for fewer steps in assembly, so our prototype uses a circular grip
design

IV. Methods

Once our design was complete, an assembly drawing packet was made; the assembly
packet includes an assembly drawing (Appendix D), detail part drawings (Appendix E,F),
and a indented bill of materials shown in Table 2 below.
Table 2. Indented Bill of Materials

After our design, material selection, and drawings were completed, the team examined
them with our technical advisor and determined the required manufacturing operations
and tooling to Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine the prototype parts from
billet 6061 Aluminum. This step resulted in manufacturing routings shown in in Figures
16-19 below.
For the bar center, 1.5'' diameter by 6.0”, 6061 Aluminum extrusion was cut to length
before being processed through two CNC lathe operations and one 4-axis CNC milling
operation. The routing determines all of the operations needed to complete the part, as
well as, lists both the machines and tools needed to complete it. OP 10 is where the
aluminum is measured and cut to length on the Horizontal Band Saw. In OP 20 a CNC
lathe is used to turn the turn stock down to the proper diameter for one side of the part,
and drilling out the inner diameter. OP 30 is another Lathe operation where the part is
held by the previously machined section in a 3-jaw chuck, turns down, and drills out the
second side. OP 40 is a CNC mill operation that contour mills the overall shape of the
exposed bar center, as well as engraves the Liquid Force logo on one side. Figure 17
shows both parts before and after the 4-axis CNC mill operations, OP 40. The final OP is
inspection for quality with calipers and visual inspection.

Figure 16: Bar Center Routing

Figure 17: Bar Center Before/After OP 40

For the bar end, a 3''x 1.5'' x 5’’ 6061 aluminum extrusion was processed through four
different milling operations, and finally inspected for quality using calipers. In OP 10 the
horizontal band saw cut the billet aluminum to length. Next, is the first CNC mill
operation, in OP 20 the shape of the bar end is cut out of one side. The part before and
directly after OP 20 is shown in Figure 19 below. In OP 30, the piece was flipped and
held in place by custom soft jaws so the opposite side could be milled. In OP 40, the bar
end was again held in custom soft jaws and milled out the rounded protrusion that fits
into the carbon tube. Finally OP 50 drilled and chamfered a hole in the top of the bar end
to create a line attachment point. OP 60 was final inspection where the critical
dimensions were inspected.

15

Figure 18: Bar End Routing

Figure 19: Bar End Before and After OP 20

Once both bar ends and the bar center were CNC machined and inspected, we cut our
purchased carbon tube to length. Stock pieces of carbon fiber .875 in OD tubes we
purchased in the form of one 48'' tube and cut into eight separate pieces for four separate
bars; two 7'' bar pieces, two 8'',two 9'' bar tubes, and the excess piece was cut in half. This
allowed us to assemble four bars. Four prototypes allowed us to test different lengths of
the bar and determine which size had the best combination of mechanical advantage for
turning the kite while still being lightweight and easy to maneuver.
An assembly routing was made to define the proper steps in the process, this can be seen
in Figure 20. OP 10, 20, and 30 involve roughing the surfaces of the parts, that will be
adhesive bonded together, with a fine 200 grit sand paper. Next, in OP 40, all sanded
16

areas were cleaned using alcohol and a cloth. OP 50 uses a high strength epoxy, DP420,
which was chosen by the team due to its wide industry use in bonding aluminum and
carbon fiber. The adhesive was applied using a paintbrush, and all excess was wiped
clean with a rag. OP 60 involved fixturing the bar to ensure all parts were aligned and the
x planes of each part were parallel. Once the parts were aligned properly, OP 70 began
which cured the epoxy in the oven. Final Inspection then took place after curing with
possible sanding if any epoxy spread onto the exterior of the joints in OP 80.

Throughout the machining and assembly process of the prototypes we recorded cycle
times. These times allowed the team to both estimate and compare our prototype
manufacturing and assembly costs to the current Liquid Force Response Bar costs. These
comparisons are in our recommendations section.
The provided charts and drawing in this section could be bundled together and provided
to a contracted manufacturer for production.
To test our design we compared the part count for the section of the bar we redesigned to
the original bar and bar end component count. The original bar and bar end had a
component count of 31 pieces. Our redesigned bar cut that by 58% with only 13 parts,
including foam floats, and leader lines taken from Liquid Force bars to complete our
prototype. A finished prototype bar is shown below in Figure 21.

Another form of testing was putting the bars to use on the water. In order to test the bar,
we used lines and safety systems taken from existing Liquid Force bars and attached
them to our bar. Three functional bars were put together and tested on the water. Initial
tests displayed that the primary functions of both turning and sheeting the kite have
remained while utilizing fewer components, better ergonomics, and a lighter bar feel.
V. Results
We successfully built a functioning prototype bar to test our design in the ocean. The
prototype is shown below in Figure 22.

Figure 22. Control Bar Prototype
Our control bar prototype closely matched the model drawings done in SolidWorks. The
only exception was the interface between the bar end and the carbon tube. According to
the drawings the aluminum should have lofted seamlessly into a circular shape to match
the tube end, but with the machining limitations it could not be done in a timely manner.
In a final production run the aluminum would be die cast and the part could be made to
specification. The line attachment points were another result that we believe needs
changing. With our current prototype the line is free to wiggle slightly and the only
attachment mechanism is the knot at the bottom of the line. We still need to figure out an
appropriate design for connecting the EVA floaters to the aluminum ends of the bar and
integrating the line attachment point into this design. A final rendering of our bar can be
seen in Figure 23.

Figure 23. Final rendering of Control Bar
Our design does provide a simple and clean kite bar, however problems may arise with
the epoxy bond between carbon and aluminum. DP420 epoxy was a good temporary
solution, however galvanic corrosion may occur down the road. Testing must be done to
18

see to what extent this corrosion would have on the safety of the bar. ASTM provides a
"Standard Guide for Conducting and Evaluating Galvanic Corrosion Tests in
Electrolyte." In order to assess the bar safety these tests could be used, as well as other
ASTM tests evaluating metals exposed to seawater. The next problem, that may arise in
the testing of this bar, is issues with exposed metal bar ends. These bar ends could
potentially hurt a person or damage other equipment in the case of an accident. This
remains an unanswered question, would it be better to switch to plastic rather than metal
bar ends, or to simply wrap the bar ends in rubber and possible source a new attachment
method if the epoxy proves to cause severe corrosion?
Below in Table 3, our team calculated the cost to make our prototype bar using cycle
times recorded on the routing sheets we designed.

Our cost to make our prototype assuming $90 machining costs and $15 labor costs was
$166.17/bar.
The prototype cost does not reflect the cost of this bar on a large scale production. The
economic impact of this bar, if it were to go into production, would be positive. To make
a comparison between producing our bar and Liquid Force’s current production cost
many assumptions/estimates were made, including:





Cast bar ends were estimated at $1.22 using CustomPartnet.com at a 80,000 part
quantity [2].
Cast bar centers were estimated at $1.83 using CustomPartnet.com at a 40,000
part quantity [2].
Assembly labor was reduced to 10% of the US cost, adjusted based off of the
Bureau of Labor Statistics data [7].
Carbon price were cut by 10% based of our team’s supplier DragonPlate’s volume
discount. [3].
19





Epoxy costs were cut down from $4/.2 oz to $.63/.2 oz when buying in 5-gallon
bulk quantities from PacknTape [8].
We cut down the warranty rate from Liquid Force's current 3.5% to 1% to factor
in for our more robust design.
Liquid Force's cost of manufacturing is $100 per bar, much of that is in the
spectra line and mainline used. Replacement spectra line cost $200, assuming a
75% margin (between both Liquid Force and the retailer) on replacement lines,
we valued the lines to make up $50 of the total bar cost. Replacement safety
system and mainline retails at $80, assuming the same margin we estimate that
this makes up $20 of the bar cost. Making these calculations we will value the
portion of the bar we redesigned to have a manufacturing cost of $30. (Liquid
Force explained that there are so many costs hidden in their BOM it is very
difficult to estimate cost of an incomplete bar.)

We estimated that we could manufacture this bar for $24.32 using the above
assumptions. While Liquid Force could produce their current bar for $30. Over one
year of production, in which they normally produce 4,000 bars this would save Liquid
Force $26,105.87. We believe these savings would easily justify the purchase of both
the bar end, and bar center mold.

As far as longevity goes, the kite industry as a whole promotes a short product lifecycle
as there is a pressure to attract consumers with a new product, outdating previous year’s
bar. This often leads to short development times and minimal testing to add new features
in time, which we believe is partially what lead to the issues with the Response bar. For
this new design, our team recommends Liquid Force use different grip styles to keep
consumer demand high year after year. Using inventory postponement, and adding grip
only when demand pulls a product through the gripping process, right before final
20

assembly. This allows Liquid Force to offer multiple colors and materials of grip, while
not holding inventory of each model. Colors, diameters, and textures could be offered to
meet different demand, such as Females, European Markets, or even customers who
desire a more personalized product and are willing to pay for customization.
Moving from a multiple component plastic bar end to a one piece cast aluminum piece
will have a positive environmental, and social benefit. Die cast aluminum is a waste free,
and recycle friendly process, compared to small plastic parts which are oil based and
have high scrap rates. This change will help to reduce Liquid Forces waste. The next way
they will eliminate waste is in warrantied bars, with less moving parts, the bar end is
much less likely to fail. This acts as a social impact as equipment failure can prove
dangerous if not fatal. Reducing bars being shipped back from consumer, to retailers, and
from retailers back to Liquid Force not only cuts costs for the company, but also less
environmental impacts due to shipping.
Another aspect of the design we did not get to in our project was implementing our color
ergonomics via grip coloring. Looking into the future, we want to have one side of the
bar colored to signify that the bar is upside down and the other side of the bar a different
color. This provides a direct visual response so the user does not become confused to
whether the bar is upside down or not after a crash. If the user is confused the situation
can become dangerous very quickly because the user thinks the kite will go one way, but
when the command is given through the bar, the opposite reaction from the kite is
observed.
VI. Conclusions
We believe our design is a viable replacement for the current Liquid Force Response bar
system because it addresses the initial faults we saw in the bar



the bar was designed with extraneous components
the bar had a lack of ergonomic design, especially in the bar ends

By employing a functional decomposition and QFD we insured that our bar performed
the same vital functions of giving the rider the ability to steer and power the kite, while
providing a simple and streamlined design and removing the excessive components that
detracted from the user experience. By the end of our project we completed our following
main goals




design and build a working prototype of a bar with the same functionality but
fewer components than the current
provide Liquid Force with a manufacturing and assembly process for the bar
including engineering drawings of the assembly and each component, and routing
sheets for all machining operations
complete a rough cost estimate for economic validation of the bar

From our literature review, functional decomposition, QFD, and prototyping processes
we gathered the following results


The majority of the components in the current bar are plastic components located
in the bar end (31 plastic components)
21







The grip should be at least a centimeter smaller than the average users grip
diameter so a stock diameter of 0.875in grip was chosen, which is similar to
existing bar diameters and satisfies the average grip diameter constraint.
Most riders surveyed preferred a grip without a large square center and ANOVA
analysis of rider preference on grip shape yielded no definitive favorite so a
circular shape grip was chosen to minimize cost
The prototype bar took a total of 1.58 hrs to machine and assemble
The final cost per bar manufactured was estimated at $22 per bar
The estimated savings for a production run of 4000 bars was $19440 for one year

Although we did not have enough time to create a grip to cover our carbon tubing, the bar
was still comfortable during testing. The only part that was questionable was the height
of the bar center. This was slightly uncomfortable since we did not have a grip in place
on top of the carbon. The manufacturing was simplified yet again by using an epoxy glue
to bond the surfaces instead of screws to attach components. We recommend extensive
testing of the glue in the water before allowing the bar onto the market to insure it doesn’t
fail over repeated use. We also recommend further research and testing of the interface
between the carbon and the aluminum since there is a potential for corrosion of the
aluminum when in contact with carbon. In addition to further testing, the bar ends should
be over-molded with some sort of rubber or EVA to provide a softer end for safety, and a
more insulated attachment point for the lines on the bar end.
