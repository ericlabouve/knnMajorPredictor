Case Study: Epoch Estate Wines Production Facility

Introduction:
The project will be a case study performed on Epoch Estate Wines Production
Facility in Templeton California. The building is a cut and cover project which was
designed to hug the existing oak trees on site. The building serves as a capstone to the
Architectural Engineering curriculum because it seamlessly combines the four main
structural building materials: steel, concrete, masonry and timber, while also including
every lateral force resisting system into one succinct project. During the design of the
project, meetings with the architecture of record and client representative occurred
where discussion about design procedure and client’s needs took place. After these
discussions, the calculation and drawing package were finalized and submitted to the
architect and advisor. The packages were then returned to the student with proposed
changes to the drawings and calculations in order to meet the needs of the architect of
record and client. All changes were made and the project was re submitted to a
standard of 75% Construction Documents phase.

The Project:
The project as stated above is a Wine Production Facility which consists of many
different programmed spaces: Administration Building, Case Storage, Fermentation
Room, Tank Room, Meeting Room, Barrel Aging Room and Barrel Vaulting Room. The
Administration Building is used for logistics such as analyzing production, and

paperwork regarding finance. The Case Storage is used for storing finished bottles.
Fermentation Room will be used for producing the wine while the Tank Room stores the
equipment associated with producing wine. Above the Fermentation Room is a Meeting
Room, which is used for meetings and conferences. Once the wine is made, it is
forklifted down the ramp into the Barrel Aging Room or Barrel Vaulting Room which is
where the wine is stored in barrels for the aging process. Project type is defined by the
International Building Code 2015 as a F-2 Factory building class. The building is located
in San Luis Obispo county, specifically on 7505 York Mountain Rd, Templeton, CA
93465.

The Architect and Client:
The architect is Brian Korte who worked for Lake Flato Architects at the time.
Brian Korte designs a lot of high end residential buildings and is known for his exposure
of structure. This exposure of structure results in a meticulous care for the detailing,
which comes from a history of furniture design. The Client is Bill Armstrong, a Colorado
native, who is CEO of Armstrong Oil and Gas Inc. He started out as a geologist who
would locate oil reserves within the soil and then buy the property to develop it and take
the oil out of it. The relationship between Brian Korte and Bill Armstrong started when
Bill Armstrong had Lake Flato Architects design his house in Colorado which was
handled by Brian Korte. Soon after, Bill Armstrong had Lake Flato Architects design his
new headquarters for his company.

Once Bill Armstrong wanted to convert his

winemaking passion into a business, he turned to Brian Korte again to design the
production facility. Bill Armstrong role in the project other than financing was his picking

of the site. Bill used his knowledge of geology to pick a good site specific to wine
making.

The Site:
The site was originally an old school house from the late 1800’s for children who
lived in the agricultural regions and could not commute to the cities. The schoolhouse
was later converted into a winery which used the space known as the Case Storage,
Fermentation Room and Tank Room. The existing winery was then demolished and set
up for a newer winery project (Epoch Estate Wines). The project is located on the top of
a hill which has a windy road leading up to the entrance. The project is cut and cover
meaning that the Barrel Aging and Barrel Vaulting area is cut into the landscape and
after construction the spaces are covered with about ten feet of dirt which was removed.
The project footprint is designed to avoid the existing oak trees on site.

The Materials:
The materials of each programmed space were chosen on architectural and
clientele factors. The Administration Building was chosen to be made out of timber with
minor architectural finishes because it is light-weight construction which would adhere
to the client’s wishes. The Case Storage building was chosen to be Vulcraft open web
joists because it would be cheaper to run MEP systems through the joists, while the
masonry bearing walls were selected in order to handle the impact loading which can
result from sloppy forklift usage but is also gives good thermal resistance for keeping
the wine bottles at a constant temperature. The Fermentation Room was chosen to be
non structural masonry walls near the fermentation equipment because of corrosion

caused by the wine making. While the steel roof framing was chosen because of the
long spans, constructability and cost advantage. The Tank Room and Meeting Room
rely on either masonry or concrete walls, which are necessary because they are used
as retaining walls. The concrete used for the Barrel Aging and Barrel Vaulting Rooms
are chosen because of the thermal efficiency. Wine should be kept a constant
temperature and thus the concrete is adequate for keeping the thermal mass of the
room constant, while also resisting the out of plane loading. The framing at the roof was
chosen to be concrete because the loading at the roof is large because of the high soil
loading and large live load which results from it being a cut and cover project.

The Design Challenges:
The Administration Building was timber framing with timber stud walls. The
framing that was chosen was engineered lumber, Truss Joist TJI primary framing and
Truss Joist LVL as rim joists and headers. This was chosen because the engineered
lumber is generally cheaper than sawn lumber. The rim joists and headers are also
engineered lumber to keep the ceiling heights consistent. While the TJI Framing was
chosen to allow easier calculations for the holes due to MEP systems. All the primary
framing was designed for loading due to wind from Chapter 30 of ASCE 7-10
(Components and Cladding). The building was governed by wind and primary lateral
force resisting system was timber stud walls which uses plywood sheathing to handle
the shear loading.
The Fermentation Room design was dictated by site and architectural conditions.
The details at the Fermentation Room were chosen as stacked framing to limit shear
tabs and because the extra cost due to ceiling height increase was not crippling to the

owner. Also the windy road would limit the size of girder members which could be
hauled out to site. Although splices could have been an option to allow bigger girders,
but with an exposed structure, the architect did not want to have any unnecessary shear
tabs to splice the girder. For the lateral system in the East-West direction, the architect
did not want to have large H.S.S. and instead requested to use small cable in an “X”
orientation detailed as Ordinary Steel Concentric Braced Frames. Similarly to the gravity
constraints, the detailing of the Ordinary Steel Moment Frames in the North-South
direction were detailed to have minor shear tabs exposed.
The Barrel Aging Room used a one way N.W. reinforced concrete slab poured
continuously with N.W. reinforced concrete beams which would frame into either a
reinforced concrete column, spiral or wall. Because the programmed space was part of
the cut and cover construction, the shear reinforcement on the beams would need to be
extensive because of the large loading of the soil, 100 psf yards and terraces live load
and the design for fire truck loading because the loading above was near the oak trees
which the site was excavated around. The walls and beam depth would also be limited
because of the owner and architectural constraints, which would become troublesome
because of the large loading on the gravity members and the out of plane loading acting
on the reinforced concrete walls.

The Coordination Challenges:
Once the building was designed and detailed, the project was reviewed by the
architect and the advisor. Soon after, the calculation and drawing packages were sent
back with proposed changes. Changes not stated above included: narrower column
spacing at fermentation room, decreasing depth of the barrel aging room beams,

changing the interior mechanical unit walls from concrete to masonry, changing the
connections at fermentation room to stacked framing to eliminate shear tabs,
downsizing the column depths of the fermentation room moment frames which resulted
in a downsizing of the girders and joists to match constructibility and the changing the
Truss Joist TJI’s in the case storage to vulcraft open web joists. Once the proposed
changes were presented to the engineering student, a strict deadline was set by the
client (advisor). After all the proposed changes were followed through with, the
calculation and drawing packages were updated and submitted to a “plan checking”
phase. After submitting, the drawings and calculations were returned back because they
were not consistent with the existing footing which exists in the Fermentation Room.
The drawings and calculations were updated and finally re submitted for the final
approval phase.

The Experience:
On top of being a capstone to the Architectural Engineering curriculum, the
project had a lot of positive experience. The project forwarded the ability to build
Engineer to Client/Architect relationships. This was important because no class within
the Architectural Engineering helps build architecture or clientele relationships, which is
arguably the most important aspect of the structural engineering discipline. The project
also allowed the engineer to visit the site during occupancy which would be extremely
beneficial to understanding the programming of the space. In comparison to every
design lab, most of the buildings are office buildings in the Architectural Engineering
curriculum, and it was worthwhile to visit the project to understand the winemaking
process. The most important experience from the project was the task of working on

multiple projects at the same time. The daily agenda of a structural engineer involves
multiple projects which could force you to change projects as soon as the phone rings.
So this project, and the project from my ARCE 452 class would give strict deadlines
which were independent of each other. Although this could make some weeks rougher
than others, it also provided great preparations for daily agenda of a structural engineer.
