INSPIRATION
In designing a thin shell structure
to cover the performance space
on Tribuna Anti Imperialista
Jose Marti, in Havana, Cuba,
we developed a heavily symbolic
concept and further abstracted it
to reach our design. Basing the
concept on the quote to the right
by Obama about US and Cuba
relations, we wanted our design
to be representative of a hand
that works to adjoin the plaza to
the US Embassy which is directly
west of the site. The “wrist” portion
adds an asymmetric element, while
the fingers provide a backdrop
to the performers as well as a view
through to the US Embassy and
Cuban flag monument behind the
space. The layering of two shell
structures helps to abstract the
hand like form, particularly in planview, and reinforces the symbolic
aspect of the two countries coming
together. Interest is also added via
an oculus in the bottom structure
that depending on the viewer’s
angle, provides images of the sky,
upper shell, or both simultaneously.

OF FRIENDSHIP TO THE
CUBAN PEOPLE... THE
CUBAN PEOPLE MUST
KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A
FRIEND AND PARTNER IN
THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA”

OUR THINNED OCULUS EDGE

OCULUS UPLIGHTING

LEG UPLIGHTING

The inspiration for having one oculus below a solid shell comes from the work of James Turrell. By
coloring the bottom face of the upper shell and thinning out the edge conditions on the oculus,
it gives the viewer directly under it the illusion of 2D space instead of 3D. This intertwines with
our design concept of two entities blending harmoniously, as the flattening essentially turns the
two shells into one. Lighting around the oculus on the top of the shell creates the same effect
at night if viewed from below, while also emphasizing that the two shells cross through each other.

CONSIDERATIONS

SAP MODELING
With a shape as complex as this,
the best way to analyze was through
the use of SAP. SAP allowed us to
iterate until we found the optimal
shell thickness of four inches.
With the upper shell measuring 76’x
170’, and the lower shell measuring
66’ x 116’, the shell’s surface area
equals roughly 9155 square feet.
Using this information we concluded
our shell weighs around 440
kips. The maximum stress values
and the maximum thrust values were
both found in the upper shell, which
makes sense as it spans further than
the lower shell. More specific stress
analysis results include:

•	 Max stress (leg au) = -2843 psi

A buckling analysis was also done,
and revealed a buckling factor of
3.236, meaning the shell would
have to be over 3 times its
existing weight before buckling
anywhere.

One obvious spot of interest in our design is the point where the two shells overlap and cross through one
another. SAP was especially helpful in proving that this design choice was not too much of a structural issue.
There was an inherent stress “hot spot” of -1319 psi at this location, and the compressive force at this
point was 11.5 kips, but neither of these numbers were large enough to denote structural failure, and thus we
were confident in our decision to overlap the shells.

SOIL BEARING FORCE

Our structure has up to 100 kips of thrust forces coming down at a forty-five degree angle into the ground.
To contain these forces, individual foundations are needed, as they will be minimally invasive in order
to preserve the existing ground pattern. They will have keys at varying depths to increase the soil bearing
force in the direction against the thrust forces. The shell will elegantly widen from four inches to two feet thick
near the footing and connect to the foundation with steel reinforcing. Each leg will be buried one foot under
the soil before tying into the poured in place foundation.

LARGE SCALE CONSTRUCTION
With the addition of the second shell,
more emphasis had to be put on how
construction would be possible. We
started with two options feasible on
their own, but in the end decided
on a hybrid between the two that
could easily translate into small scale
construction as well. Our concept
combines a typical and more creative
strategy that somewhat resembles
standard construction methods
for multilevel concrete elevated
decks. First, we will form and
shore the underside of the lower
shell, using typical curved wooden
formwork and metal scaffolding for
support. This shell will be poured.
While the concrete is in the process
of curing, we will construct the
formwork for the upper shell out
of scaffolding and custom cut foam
blocks, resting the upper formwork
on the lower shell when necessary.
We will not remove any shoring
until both shells have cured and
the concrete has reached design
strength. Once cured, all shoring and
formwork can be removed, beginning
with the top shell.

Our original idea was to construct the entirety of our design on our 9’ x 5’ frame, however it was encouraged
that we only construct a section, as building the entire design would be beneficial to our understanding of the
project, but it would be an inefficient use of the frame. Knowing that meant part of our design would have
to cantilever and introduce tension into a compression only structure, we decided to test the portion
we wanted to build at full scale in SAP. The shell was tested to see force intensities both with and without a
shoring support in order to determine how to treat the upper cantilevered portion after pouring.

Modeling our project proved to be
quite the task. Our first challenge
was providing a smooth doubly
curved surface on both shells. We
accomplished this with a waffle grid
formwork, developed by putting
our Rhino model into Autodesk Slicer
for Fusion 360. In order to make this
rigid enough and solid enough to
pour concrete on, newspaper and
spray insulation were used to fill
the voids. After cutting enough foam
off to get down to the cardboard and
get the curved shape of our shell,
we were still left with a very porous
surface, and therefore ended up
putting a layer of plaster over the
whole form. This was repeated for
the upper shell’s formwork. Once the
first shell was poured, we excavated
part of its formwork to get the crossthrough effect we wanted. Foam
blocks and curved rebar were
employed to help reinforce and
ensure a continuous pour through
the bottom shell. Even though the
design was challenging in form, the
meticulous thought that went into the
formwork ensured our success.

Despite being different majors, our whole group certainly found this studio a unique, but worthwhile
experience. We definitely believe that Ed’s mantra of “you can’t tell who’s an architect and who’s an ARCE”
was especially applicable to our team, as we balanced all responsibilities between the two disciplines, and
never found ourselves having a disconnect between the design and its structural feasibility or placing more
importance on one discipline’s contribution than the other like is typical of the professional world.
	
Some of our biggest challenges this quarter did not come from our team dynamic, which was essentially
perfect as far as team projects go, but from multiple outside influences that were skeptical of our design choices
and worried for our success later on in the quarter. In retrospect, we are extremely happy of our choice to stick
by our design and see it through until the end despite the possibilities of failure, because it shows just how
much can be accomplished when different fields work together. That being said, I think this was also a valuable
experience for each discipline to see what skills the other uses on a regular basis and how to combine them into
a successful project, since we’re usually only exposed to the other group’s curriculum once or twice throughout
our education.
	
With how complicated our design was, looking back there are definitely some things we would have
done differently, despite how successful we were in designing and constructing our double shell structure. The
first thing we would have done differently was to start with a hanging cloth model, or multiple, instead of relying
on tripods and Rhino’s patching tool to give us our vertical form. This would streamline our design process,
and work as a more convincing visual aid for critiques. Additionally, digitizing the cloth model we ended up
with ensured our success when modeling with SAP - if we had relied solely on tripods and Rhino, our shape
would probably not have been completely funicular. The next learning curve we had was while constructing our
formwork, but wasn’t so much a problem as a means to be efficient and save materials. If we were to do the
project again, we would minimize spray foam infill in the waffle by adding square supports close to the top of the
waffle, much like we tried to do with the upper shell’s waffle. The place we learned the most though, was after
the actual construction in the revealing of the shell, since none of us had worked with concrete in this manner
before. While our formwork slipped out nearly effortlessly, all of us were a little shocked with the surface quality
on the inside. Given how many spots had air pockets that showed part of the reinforcing mesh, we deducted
that in the future, a concrete with an even lower slump should be mixed in order to get through to the formwork’s
surface. To further perfect the surface quality, we should have used a plastic tarp over our plaster layer to get the
extremely smooth surface other groups had. Even with these all these things we would change for next time, we
still feel this was an extremely successful project and something we can be proud of!
