Summary of Long Beach Remodel
For my senior project, I created a set of plans for a remodel of a single family residence located
in Long Beach, California. The project mandate included the following:
1) Create a set of as-built drawings (i.e. existing drawings of the building and site)
2) Work with an architect on a proposed design
3) Produce a set of structural drawings and calculations
The house was built in 1949. The prior owner of the house added a detached three-car garage and
converted an existing attached garage into a den. The current owner wanted to demolish the den
and build a larger family and dining room, and a more functional kitchen.
A surveyor was hired to identify the two front corners of the lot. Without a survey, it would have
been difficult to determine exactly where the property lines were located and thus, how to “set”
the house on the lot.
Meeting California’s stringent Title 24 Energy Requirements was a challenging aspect of the
project, based on the proposed window, glass door, and skylight configuration. Unfortunately,
just upgrading the insulation in the floors, walls and ceilings wasn’t enough to meet California’s
Title 24 Energy Requirements. We faced a choice of either having to upgrade the existing
windows in the house or converting the existing conventional water heater to a more energy
efficient tankless model. Due to more favorable economics, we proceeded with the tankless
model.
Another challenge we faced was making sure the new roof would plane in properly with the
existing roof. The existing roof was framed with 2x4 members, which were of sufficient strength
per code when the house was built in 1949. However, under the current code, roof framing
members required more strength. Since the owner wanted to expedite construction, we decided
to use roof trusses. This also enabled ceiling heights and eaves to match up, without a great deal
of labor.
I decided to pursue this project primarily because I wanted “hands on” experience creating a
comprehensive set of construction documents. Wood construction is something I can relate to
well given my background and find it to be an aesthetically appealing material. I suspect wood
design will be an important part of my focus as an engineer.
The documents that follow include a set of as-built drawings, a proposed design and structural
drawings and details. I also included in the package that follows a set of calculations for gravity
and lateral loads.
