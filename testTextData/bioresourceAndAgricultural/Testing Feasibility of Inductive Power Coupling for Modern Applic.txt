ABSTRACT

This project takes two bifilar tesla coils and uses them to find a % efficiency of
power transfer as distances between the coils decrease. The reason this
experiment is being conducted is to find possible implications for wireless
charging of vehicles using similar style coils. This project conducted experiments
on 60 Hz, 400 Hz, and 1 kHz frequencies for a small input signal. The general
conclusion is that as the frequency increases more power can be transferred and
higher efficiency of power transfer is seen. This project also concluded that it
could be possible to get higher efficiency at a greater distance with a higher input
power frequency. There would of course be tradeoffs for achieving a certain
charge time, but this project is concerned in the possibility of a greater gap being
used so that charging could be done on a wide variety of vehicle applications.
These applications would range from public transport, domestic, or freight.

INTRODUCTION

Wireless power was first discovered by a man named Nikola Tesla, one of the
brightest, yet possibly most insane inventors of the 19th century. From his
Colorado Springs weather experiments to the AC Motor, he has impacted the
world so much as to give us a basis for power transfer that superseded that of
Thomas Edison. Unfortunately, he died before any of his larger, more intriguing
experiments could come to fruition, such as his large scale Tesla Coils for
widespread power transfer. Yet still his ideas have been implemented in ways
even he couldn’t have imagined like Wi-Fi systems that enjoyed at local
Starbucks’. One true travesty of his early demise is that he never was able to see
the abuse of the motor industry that utilizes his AC motor and its stagnation for
experimentation and technological improvement. Tesla’s design for the AC motor
was created in the late 19th century, and the US Department of Transportation
reports that the MPG for the average car in 2015 is only six MPG greater than
cars created in 2005. This a shockingly small change for such a long period of
time, most likely caused by ties drawn between oil and car companies creating a
system where they benefit from each other’s lack of technological advancements.
Electric vehicles have been around since the 1980s yet Tesla, the car company,
has just begun to become a house-hold name after decades of the idea being
around.
No, electric cars will not correct the effects of global warming and greenhouse
gas emissions, but it’s a baby step in the right direction towards a brighter,
smarter future. Integrating electric vehicles into systems that do not utilize fossil
fuels for their power source is something that is not backed by the US
Government as much as it is in other countries. Korea, for example, has the
Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) busses that use resonant inductive
charging (RIC) to charge the bus at bus stops. It uses a battery with a rather
short supply, but since it gets frequent, short charges, it is able to stay charged to
run the whole day with zero emissions. Thankfully, there are some bright minds
in the California legislature who passed the Green Schools Initiative launching
California as the nation-wide leader of solar power for schools. The Solar
Foundation states that nearly 1000 schools in 2012 had installed solar panels on
their school roofs and over their parking lots, creating a capacity of 218 kW.
While this is an amazing step for creating widespread availability of natural
energy, there is still more that can be done by integrating systems like RIC into
the parking spaces and creating an intuitive, easy way to charge vehicles without

2

the concern of the consumer. At local stores (e.g. Walmart, Target, etc...) there
has been an increase in parking spaces designated for electric vehicles complete
with a charging station. This is a positive initiative but there are problems with
direct connection chargers. People could steal the copper contacts, vandalize the
hosing and charge bay, weather conditions (rain and humidity) could degrade the
contacts, and uninformed persons could misuse or damage either the charger or
their car charge port. This is why there is a need for an RIC system that could get
rid of these issues. Taking the method from the OLEV bus, having a charge bay
underneath a parking space would allow the consumer to simply park their car
and go on with their day as it charges. They would be unaware of the charging
and for most cases (suburban living and general transportation) would not need
to worry about their battery life.
RIC is a complicated task to tackle, so this project will take the basis of the idea
and attempt to find a convention for using different types of inductors and see if
they could have a place in modern day designs for wireless power charging.
Perhaps the largest issue at hand is that as distances increase between primary
and secondary coils, the efficiency of the power transfer worsens. This project
will take the bifilar coil and determine possible uses and efficiency ranges for a
variety of distances. Since this project’s main focus will be for future use this
project will assess the capabilities of the coils with varying frequency over varying
distance. This will be done by applying an input signal via a signal generator and
amplifying the signal with an operational amplifier. The output voltage will be
recorded as the distance decreases to see the effects of frequency on the
declining distance. With this data recorded a %efficiency can be found and used
to make conclusions about usable ranges and possible future applications.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Background. During a class experiment in 1819, Hans Christian Oersted
accidently discovered the magnetic field by having a compass near a charged
circuit, effectively giving birth to the study of electromagnetism. (Knight 2007)
Taking Oersted’s discovery, Michael Faraday discovered the laws of
electromagnetic induction in 1831 when turning electromagnets on and off on a
closed loop circuit. (Knight 2007) Faraday’s law states that a time-varying flux
causes an induced electromotive force, or emf. (Rizzoni 2005) The magnitude of
an emf, epsilon (ε), is shown below in Equation 1:

𝑑𝛷𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑐𝑜𝑖𝑙

𝜀 = 𝑁|

𝑑𝑡

| = 𝑁|

𝑑𝐴𝐵
𝑑𝑡

|

(1)

This equation defines phi (Φ) as the magnetic flux that is equal to A*B, where A
is the area of the loop, and B is the magnetic field. Dividing the emf by the
resistance in the circuit will solve for the induced current, I, as shown in equation
2:

𝐼=

𝜀
𝑅

(2)

It is important to note that there will be no emf if the voltage through an inductor
coil is constant, only when there is a change in voltage. This was discovered by
moving magnets in and out of the circuit, or in Oersted’s case, a compass flipping
sides. The readings in current meters, or from the compasses, showed that there
was a directionality with the emf.
Lenz’s Law, discovered by Heinrich Lenz in 1834, creates the basis for the “right
hand rule” for the orientation of the magnetic field created. Lenz’s Law states:
“There is an induced current in a closed, conducting loop if and only if the
magnetic flux through the loop is changing. The direction of the induced current
is such that the induced magnetic field opposes the change in the flux.” (Knight
2007) Figure 1 shows an example of the right-hand-rule and how it can
determine the direction of the resultant magnetic field based on the direction of

4

induced current. In the case of a wire, pointing your right thumb in the direction of
the current, the other fingers of the hand will show the direction of the resulting
magnetic field. In the case of a coil, the thumb will point in the direction of the
magnetic field (through the middle of the coil) and the fingers will wrap in the
direction of the induced current.

Figure 1: The Right-hand Rule as shown in Rizzoni 2005 Figure 16.4
Lenz’s Laws can be seen in solenoid applications and there are three things that
describe the changing flux: The magnetic field through the loop changes, the
loop changes in area or angle, or the loop moves into or out of the magnetic field.
This project will be using the first method which is the field changing without the
loop moving. The way that the magnetic field changes without movement is by
using alternating current (AC) to power a circuit with inductive coupling. This can
be seen in applications like the transformer in Figure 2.

Figure 2: A transformer with a primary and secondary coil as shown in Knight
2007 Figure 34.38
“Alternating current through the primary coil causes an oscillating magnetic flux
through the secondary coil, causing the emf.” (Knight 2007) The coils in Figure 2

5

are wrapped around a conductive iron core undergoing alternating induced
currents to generate electromotive forces. This ultimately gives birth to
alternating current as a form of power for the entire world, later proposed by
Nikola Tesla in the late 1800s. By using different frequencies, the alternating
current reverses the magnetic field a number of times per second, which is very
similar to how Faraday and Oerstad first discovered emf by switching the
direction of a magnet or turning off the induced current to a circuit. Examples of
the utilities of a transformer are powerlines that use 60 Hz frequency for North
and South America. Other applications include radio, television, and
telecommunication services that use frequencies ranging 10^2 to 10^9 Hz.
(Knight 2007) The primary and secondary coils of Figure 2 determines the ratio
of voltage transfer in the system as seen in equation 3:

𝑉2 =

𝑁2

𝑉
𝑁1 1

(3)

A step-up transformer, with N2 >> N1 boosts the voltage of a generator allowing
for better transportation of energy through powerlines. The more common seen
transformers are those used in urban areas, called step-down transformers,
where N1 >> N2, so that the voltage can be lowered for house-hold appliances.
(Knight 2007)
In order to calculate the efficiency of the power transfer across the primary and
secondary coils, the power of each needs to be calculated. Knight (2007) defines
power as the rate of energy transfer in equation 4:

𝑃 = 𝐼𝑉

(4)

Taking the power calculated across the primary and secondary coils (to be
further defined as P1 for primary and P2 for secondary), setting them equal to
each other and then dividing P2 by P1 to find the efficiency of the power transfer
as seen in equation 5:

𝑃

𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑦 = 𝑃2

Bifilar Coil. This project will utilize two Bifilar coils (flat wound copper coil) (Figure
3)
The Bifilar coil, commonly known as the Pancake Tesla Coil, was patented by
Nikola Tesla in 1894. It takes the traditional longitudinal wound copper wire,
stacks it on itself, and makes a flat, pancake-like shape. The bifilar coil can have
one wire wrapped tightly together, or it could have two wires bound together, and
may have shielded wires to reduce the amount of power losses at higher
frequency usage.

Figure 3. Depiction of a Bifilar Coil. Patented by Nikola Tesla. Tesla, N. 1894
Figure 2.
Types of power losses for these inductors include eddy currents and skin effects.
“[Eddy currents is the] dissipation of energy into heat” inside of the core (Rizzoni
2005). As the magnetic flux affects the core the conductor will heat up and there
will be a direct loss of energy in the form of heat. This makes the ferrite core
impractical in situations without good ventilation or in smaller applications where
heat could cause malfunctions of a device. Instead, by using an air core, there
will be less losses for some of its applications, but not all. Known as skin effect,
there are losses in an air core that is based on the cross sectional area of the
wire used for the coil. “With a round wire this causes the current density to be
maximum at the surface and least at the center” (Terman 1943). This is why
several types of air cores can be found on the market utilizing rectangular wire
designs. By flattening the wire used, it increases the outer surface area, which in
turn, reduces the amount of inner material that will not carry as much current.
Essentially, when more material is carrying more current (when flattened or
elongated), the higher the inductance and lower the resistance (Terman 1943).
Current Technologies. There are several types of systems for dynamic charging
of electric vehicles, such as the OLEV bus in Korea (Jeong el. al. 2015) and also

7

the inductive power transfer highway. (Russer et. al. 2014) These systems utilize
an isolated long track of primary coil that is underground and secondary coils
inside the moving vehicle. (Wang et. al. 2005) Figure 4 shows a simplified
version of how it works, where the primary coil could run along a length of
highway, utilizing power from the grid to generate its initial magnetic field. The
secondary coil would line the underside of the car and there would be an internal
converter to switch the absorbed magnetic field into DC power to power the
electric motor.

Figure 4: Idea of a dynamic charging system for a car and length of road. Wang
et. al. 2005
The issue with using this for cars is that to maximize efficiency of the circuit, the
height of the cars would need to all be the same. This puts an additional design
constraint on car makers, but also leaves way for innovation on side of the
secondary coil and internal inverter as it is up to the car maker for the optimal
way to design it. In the application of the public transport bus in Korea, the OLEV
bus was able to use smaller, lighter batteries for its power source because it was
always frequently charging in small bursts. (Jeong et. al. 2015)
Russer et. al. (2015) propose a method of magnetic-resonant wireless power
transfer (MRWPT) that could solve the current problem of inefficiency in roadway
powering of electric vehicles. Using a similar method to a parked car format for
wireless charging, the circuit that has a length of multiple loops of primary coils
that will only activate when there is full alignment with the secondary coil. This,
most likely, is to maximize efficiency, but could also minimize the amount of
wasted energy by having a constantly powered roadway system. This can be
seen in figure 5, with the load moving to the right, as it crosses from LP2 to LP3.
The switches activate when the maximum current has been reached, switching
the magnetic wave generation from one primary coil to the next. This will also
help the spread of the wave function, attempting to keep the phases as close as

8

possible to maximize current flow. (Note: Figure 7 depicts a design indicative of a
resonant inductive system, which is not what will be studied for this project.)

Figure 5: Proposed circuit for the Primary coil (bottom) as the roadway circuit
connected to the power grid, and the secondary coil (top, load circuit) that feeds
into the car to charge the vehicle. Russer et. al. 2015

The relevance of this project is to see if the aforementioned inductors could be
beneficial to the OLEV and other dynamic systems. By testing the range
(efficiency and distance between coils) at which these inductor types can be
used could be transferred to larger scale applications. In order to find out which
type is more beneficial for a long range system, this project will require multiple
types to be tested. Hopefully, a conclusion can be made between the usefulness
of a certain type of inductor at longer ranges so that it can be utilized in future
applications.

PROCEDURE AND METHODS

Design Procedure

Design and Building of Coil Builder. In order for the coils to be wound tightly and
easily, a device was designed and built to accommodate the process. The
materials used are shown in Figure 6 and listed below.

B: 12”x12”x0.220” acrylic with two 1/32” holes and one ½” hole.

D: Tape
E: Two 200’ spools of 20 AWG copper wire
F: One 5” long ½”-13 threaded bolt
G: Two half inch washers
H: One ½”-13 nut

The acrylic used can be more clearly seen in Figure 7. The top acrylic piece has
slots so that epoxy can be added once the turning of the coil has been
completed. The bottom acrylic piece has two 1/32” holes for where the wires will
be pinned down to create an anchor point for turning the coil. These holes are
drilled ¾” away from the center hole so that a washer can fit between both acrylic
pieces and act as a spacer.

Figure 7: Acrylic 12"x12"x0.220". The right piece is to act as a top and is slotted
for accessibility to the wire to put on epoxy or fix layout of wire. The left piece is
to act as a bottom that fits the copper wire.

The acrylic pieces will be bound together with the ½”-13 threaded bolt and nut
with the spacer in between as shown in Figure 8. Also shown in Figure 8 are two
1/32” holes just outside of the diameter of the washer allowing for room for the
copper wire and will act as anchor points during the turning of the coil.

11

Figure 8: Acrylic assembled with ½”-13 threaded bolt, ½”-13 nut, and washer as
a spacer. (A) and (B) from Figure 1 are used as a top and bottom piece
respectively.
With a form developed for how to turn the coils efficiently, the building of the coils
can begin.

Turning the Coils. The spools of copper wire are inserted into the small holes of
the bottom acrylic piece then being affixed to the bottom of the acrylic with tape.
It is important to remember which wire end is from which spool because two
need to be soldered together, while two will be used as a positive and negative
end of the coil. This initial setup is shown below in Figure 9.

12

Figure 9: 20 AWG copper wire inserted to bottom acrylic piece and fixed with
tape.

For the finished coil, either (A) and (C), or (B) and (D) need to be soldered
together, therefore it is important to pay careful attention to how this setup is
done as to not confuse which wires will be soldered and which will be left alone.
This can be done by keeping the positions of the spools constant, and turning the
acrylic, counting the amount of turn based off of the initial contact area of the two
wires. The way it is setup in Figure 9, that turn count position also correlates to
one of the slots of the top acrylic piece.
With the wires in place, the bolt is then slotted, the washer put around it, then the
acrylic pieces can be tightened together. The nut should be tightened until the
acrylic pieces cannot shift positions. Keeping the wire taught, turn the acrylic and
begin turning the coil. Figure 10 shows the first few turns of a coil.

13

Figure 10: Close up of the first few turns of a coil.

As the number of turns increases it can be hard to keep the wire organized, but
the slots on the top acrylic allow for some maintenance. However, if the wire is
too thin it may be difficult to maintain tidiness. It is more important to keep the
wire tight so that it does not loosen and cause gaps in the finished coil and also
to ensure it does not unwind when loosening the bolt and taking the contraption
apart.
For this project two coils were made: One with 80 turns and the other with 120
turns. This was done to create a turn ratio of 2:3. This was done to mimic what
would most likely be a future setup for future applications by using a step up
system.
When the desired amount of turns has been reached, the slots in the top acrylic
provide a space for epoxy to be added as seen in Figure 11. Before removing the
coil and cutting it free from the copper spools, a length of about 2 feet of wire was
left loose for use in circuitry and soldering later on.

14

Figure 11: Finished coil with first application of epoxy

After the first set of epoxy has hardened, the coil can be removed and will keep
reasonably tight. It can then be flipped over and epoxied on the opposite side, or
taped and epoxied in higher quantity outside of the acrylic contraption. Figure 12
shows one of the finished coils made for this project. It was removed before
being fully epoxied on the backside so that it could be epoxied to a piece of
Lexan as flat as possible. The Lexan is used for the experimental procedure
discussed further in the next section.

Experimentation Equipment. The main experimental hardware consists of two
8”x6”x2” pieces of wood, and two 12”x12”x0.093” pieces of Lexan. Two holes
were drilled into each piece: a 3/8” hole and a ½” hole. Each piece of Lexan was
attached to a piece of wood so that it could stand freely, as seen in Figure 13.

D: 741 operational amplifier
E: 1.5 Ohm resistor (Dale CW-2C Wire wound resistor)
F: 100k Ohm resistor

Figure 14: Equipment for Experimentation Procedure with callouts

The coils epoxied to the Lexan and the copper wires trimmed and soldered
accordingly as seen in Figure 15. The wires that were initially used as anchors
for turning will go through the center hole of the Lexan. A hole closer to the
bottom of the piece – located near the wood base – will act as the location for the
brass rod to bind both mounted coils together. This brass rod, accompanied with
the brass washers and nuts, will help keep the coils lined up and tightening the
nuts will draw the coils closer together to gather experimental data.
The load resistor is a 1.5 Ohm wire-wound resistor which is more capable of
dealing with higher temperatures and current than the average resistor. The 100k
ohm resistor is used as the grounding resistor in the open loop operational
amplifier circuit to increase the gain as much as possible to increase the input
signal of the function generator.

to Lexan sheets and wood base
The experiment required taking the assembly in Figure 9 and adding circuits to
the front end of the primary coil and a load resistor to the secondary coil (left and
right coils respectively).
The rest of the experimentation equipment can be seen in Figure 16 which
shows the actual testing setup during the testing. Schematics for the circuit
created to gather data can be seen in Appendix C. The additional equipment was
available to students via the BRAE labs 3-e and 7 and are listed below:

oscilloscope cable, function generator cable, and
measurement equipment to keep the bases straight

Due to the limited length of the function generator, oscilloscope, and coil wires,
the experiment was limited to the available desk space and proved difficult to
keep tidy while gathering experimental data. The additional metal equipment (like
the tri-square) did not seem to have any effects on the input or output signals, but
the equipment in the lab itself may have caused there to be additional levels of
noise adding some variance to the readings.

Testing Procedure

The coils, mounted to the wood and Lexan base, are connected with a ½”-13
brass rod and held together with ½”-13 nuts and washers. (Figure 16)
The virtual bench allows for an oscilloscope readout for two channels. Channel
one was also used as a voltage source. The virtual bench itself does not output
much power, so an operational amplifier was used to attempt to increase the
voltage of the signal. For most of the experimentation, the input voltage
fluctuated slightly, but overall an average value of 2.22 Volts was seen.

19

Figure 17. Simplified testing setup showing the wood and Lexan
base for the coils. Distance x reduced for each data point.
The primary coil side had two nuts bound together on both sides of the Lexan to
try and keep the rod as straight as possible and keep the secondary coil lined up
with it.
The secondary coil just had a single nut attached that, when tightened, would
slowly bring the secondary coil closer to the primary coil, reducing the distance x
as shown in Figure 17.
The function generator, via the Virtual Bench, was used to output an analog
signal of 60, 400, and 1000 Hz. The circuits and probes were connected to the
coils and a preliminary test was performed to find a rough beginning range for the
test to begin at. This was done by using the 1 kHz function generator and moving
the coils apart from each other. 1 kHz was used because it was the most
sensitive system. When there began to be a steady increase in power to the
channel two probe that was definitely not variance due to noise, that would be
the starting point. This point was determined to be 155 mm.
At the initial starting distance the other two frequencies used: 60 and 400 Hz;
were less subjected to change as the distance decreased between the coils. The
data points at this point in the experiment were 5 mm apart until there was a
notable trend in output signal for the 60 Hz and 400 Hz frequencies. When that
trend started to form in the 60 Hz data (because it is the least sensitive), the data
points were condensed to 2 mm and then finally to 1 mm for the final few tests.
For recording the data at each data point there is a button labeled “single” that
acts as a picture of the data instead of using the rather variable “auto” setting.

20

With this single, or snapshot, method, a measurement was taken every 15
seconds, for 45 seconds, at each distance and each frequency. An average
value of all three points would be used for the final data interpretation. The data
gathering process was done this way to eliminate selection bias, which is
essentially trying to record values that would make the test look better. By
recording data at exact intervals, using the “single” feature, that bias was lowered
(not necessarily eliminated) and then averaged to give a more “likely” outcome of
results.
The distance between the coils was measured with calipers and was kept
straight using a tri-square. The primary coil side was essentially fixed and used
as a reference for keeping the coils square and in line. This was done by lining
up the base of the primary coil in the corner of the tri-square, and fixing the
Lexan – and therefore the primary coil – between two tight nuts. The secondary
coil had another nut and when tightened would slowly draw the secondary coil
towards the primary coil.
Data was recorded at the following intervals:
1) 5 mm intervals from 155 mm to 70 mm for a total of 18 data points.
2) 2 mm intervals from 70 mm to 30 mm for a total of 20 data points.
3) 1 mm intervals from 30 mm to 19 mm for a total of 10 data points.
There was a total of 48 data points that were used to dictate a trend line for each
frequency used.
The measurements for the distance were taken between both ends of the
mounted Lexan. The actual coils were about 14 mm closer together. The
corrected distance is used in the data sheets shown in Appendix D. The
measurements were taken this way because there was a bit of slack due to the
weight of the coils on the Lexan which was not intended and formed after
assembly. This slack caused a very slight forward bend in the Lexan sheets and
both coils, making the final data points more like average distances than exact
distances. Again, the bend is very slight and only impacted the final range of data
points as ranges closer than 5mm could not be used because the very top of the
coils would touch if moved any closer.

21

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Effects of Frequency. The graphs in Appendix E clearly show an indication that
the effect on voltage output is greatly increased by the higher frequency of the
input signal. These graphs also show that a power curve trend line fit nearly
perfectly into most of the data sets. Having higher frequency also seemed to
increase the range at which the power transfer would occur. The starting point
was initially chosen because the output signal began to noticeably increase at 1
kHz. The frequency in which data was recorded was changed when all three
frequencies began to show increase in output voltage readings. This could have
been misconstrued due to some issues with noise, which there clearly was upon
close inspection of the first data points for each frequency. However, another
effect increasing the frequency seemed to have was that the variance in the
signal for both input and output was decreased. With this, there also seemed to
be a decrease in the impact of noise as the testing went on. This is seen by
having a higher R2 value in the trend line developed in the output voltage graphs
of Appendix E. The same graphs also show the results getting “tighter” as the
frequency increases again representing how variance in the readouts were
decreasing with change in frequency.
With the increase in frequency, the efficiency, shown by the %eff value on the
data tables in Appendix D, increases as the distance decreases. This is an effect
that is supposed to happen in general with the coils as they are more effective
the closer they are together. The interesting part is the rate at which the increase
in output voltage occurs as the frequency increases. The implication here is that
assuming the system does not overheat, a higher frequency could be used to
increase both the distance between coils and the amount of power transferred
while still achieving ample % efficiency.
Expectations and Implications. The test was expected to show that as the coils
were nearer to each other that the power transfer would nearly be equivalent,
even at lower frequencies. However, the test showed that at 60 Hz the power
transfer was almost nonexistent. Whereas, with the 400 Hz and 1 kHz signals,
the coils started to show large increases in efficiency around 30 mm and 40 mm
respectively. (Appendix E – Figures 20 and 21) This translates to about an inch
to an inch and a half gap. The coils used were very small and the overall
assumption of this test is that the same data would carry over and be magnified
by the size of the coils. This means that as the size of the coils increase then
perhaps the distance potential could increase as well. Since larger coils would be
capable of withstanding and dissipating more heat, a larger input signal could be

22

used and perhaps even a higher frequency as well (beyond 1 kHz as used in this
experiment).
Appendix D shows the data tables for each of the performed tests. In Table D-1,
the efficiency for the test never exceeds 1%. This leads to the conclusion that for
ample power transfer, the frequency would most definitely not work with simple
wall power fed into a primary coil. In Table D-2 there starts to be increasingly
larger %efficiency jumps as the distance closes. This trend isn’t as easily seen in
the 60 Hz table or in the graphs. Still, the maximum efficiency peaks at about
27% and only for the closest value. The point of this experiment was not to prove
that efficiency is highest for the closest value, but that the point at which the rate
begins to increase could dictate possible ranges for use. So, turning to Table D3, the peak efficiency is around 90% at the closest position, and the previously
highest efficiency of 27% (seen in Table D-2) is realized in Table D-3 between 12
to 13mm. This is a jump of nearly 10 mm, which isn’t much, but again this test
used a very small signal, with very small coils. At least in regards to this
experiment, it seems that with increasing frequencies that range of efficiency
difference will begin to increase as well, which could possibly lead to better
results when increasing the distance between coils.
The major implication here then is that if coils roughly the diameter of the width of
a car were to be used (about 65-70 inches for sedans) then the gap between the
primary and secondary coils could be relatively large without a major decrease in
efficiency. With a very rough estimation, if the test outcome from this procedure
was simply multiplied by 10 to compare it to a larger coil, then at about a gap of
400 mm would be the beginning of the increase in efficiency for the larger coil
system. Obviously, this is a very crude estimation to make, but when the margin
for usage changes from 1 inch to 15 inches, suddenly the possibilities for use
become much larger. With a larger coil there could be more environment effects
on the coil and on the power transfer, however, as seen in this experiment, as
the frequency increases, the variance tends to lessen. (Appendix E)
Experiment Validation. Similar experiments were performed with resonant circuits
so the results are expected to be different in what they are looking for, namely
the power transfer when both coils are functioning at resonance or at matching
impedance. However, by interpreting some of the 3D graphs comparing load
impedance, distance between coil, and efficiency of wireless power transfer
(WPT), Rotaru et. al (2014) show comparable results. The results shown in their
graphical data show off a similar power curve trend that was seen in the
graphical data of this experiment. The experiments conducted by Rotaru et. al

23

(2014) were done at a much higher frequency (10 kHz) and withstanding much
higher power (2 kW). Yet, there experimental procedure seemed to be very
similar to the one conducted here but utilizing the resonant features of the coils
rather than simply the inductive capabilities. Their experiment showed that with
the resonance of their coil paired with matching impedance the power transfer
efficiency was still high even at further distances. Their experimental data shows
distances of up to 300 mm, which would not be possible with the way data was
gathered with this project’s experiment, possibly due to the size of the coil and
the lack of use of resonant circuits. However, this seems to validate the data
gathered here that the nature of the inductive capabilities of the coils used
follows a power curve trend.

24

RECOMMENDATIONS

For future testing, it would be very interesting to see if the data gathered at
similar ranges in this study could be repeated with larger coils. That would
hopefully mean that the conclusions made in this experiment do hold some
weight and that future applications could be useful.
A change that could be made to the testing procedure is to see the effects of
having several different gauges of wire – both smaller and larger.
With the increase in coil size for future testing, the frequency range of these tests
could also increase. This would hopefully lead to the same conclusions made
here that the efficiency range would increase as the frequency increases.
One way that this experiment could be implemented in the real world is a carport-charger that would be placed underneath a vehicle. This would require a kit
to protect the coils from any environmental or direct-physical damages. It would
be an interesting experiment to see how well the coils function with a bulk of
material in the way. Assumedly that material would impact (perhaps a hard
plastic) the emf in a minor way, but still any impact with a large distance between
coils could cause a charge time to increase quite a bit.
Another change that can be made is making a series of bifilar coils and stacking
them together to see the impacts of using multiples of coils either stacked in line
or offset to create different patterns. It would be assumed that by having a set of
smaller coils it would act similarly to having one larger coil, but any impact that
may occur due to offset or misalignment could be lowered.

APPENDIX A: HOW PROJECT MEETS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BRAE
MAJOR

29

Major Design Experience

The BRAE senior project must incorporate a major design experience. Design is
the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet specific needs.
The design process typically includes fundamental elements as outlined below.
This project addresses these issues as follows.

Establishment of Objectives and Criteria. Project objectives and criteria are
established to meet the needs and expectations of the BioResource and
Agricultural Engineering Department of Cal Poly SLO.

Synthesis and Analysis. The project required the building of an experiment to
test the efficiency of an inductive power coupling system. This will incorporate
common circuit calculations, analysis of efficiency of a power transfer system,
and the recommendation for future applications.

Construction, Testing, and Evaluation. The inductive coupling circuit was
designed, constructed, tested, and evaluated for efficiency, and optimal
operational distance and frequency.

Incorporation of Applicable Engineering Standards. The project utilizes IEEE,
NEC, and SAE standards for recommended practice for Inductive Coordination of
Electric Supply.

30

Capstone Design Experience.

The BRAE senior project is an engineering design project based on the
knowledge and skills acquired in earlier coursework (Major, Support and/or GE
courses). This project incorporates knowledge/skills from these key courses:

ENGL 149 Technical Writing
BRAE 151 AutoCAD
BRAE 216 Fundamentals of Electricity
BRAE 328 Measurements and Computer Interfacing
EE 321/361 Electronics and Electronics Laboratory

Design Parameters and Constraints.

This project addresses a significant number of the categories of constraints listed
below.
Physical. Creation of a testing apparatus for inductive power coupling.
Economic. Testing potential for wireless charging to be efficient enough for
multiple applications such as: domestic, freight, and public transport, removing
the need to waste time going to the pump to charge or refuel a vehicle.
Environmental. Increasing the efficient usage and quality of life for electrically
driven vehicles and users will add incentives for switching to electrical vehicles
for means of transportation. Using electrical vehicles rather than carbon-fuelbased vehicles will lead to positive impacts on the environment.
Sustainability. Wireless charging components will be less susceptible to erosion
and weathering as their direct charging counterparts.
Manufacturability. The same technology being researched here can be used in
many other smaller applications such as phone chargers or to power small
devices.
Health and Safety. Depending on the frequency of the applied signal, the emf
generated could have adverse effects on the human body with prolonged
exposure, however the overall impact is still unknown. If the frequency is high
enough, sound can lead some to discomfort. Otherwise, utilizing wireless
charging instead of direct charging would assumedly be safer for the user.

31

Ethical. When the technology develops for better batteries and charging
technologies, there will be a reduction in total energy used.
Social. Ease and efficiency of charging could influence more widespread usage.
Political. Promote the use of more sustainable technology in agriculture and
domestic practices.
Aesthetic. Vehicles utilizing a wireless charging system would have their means
of recharging hidden would could allow for designers to have more intricate
exterior designs of vehicles that do not need to incorporate a port for direct
charging. Wireless charging can also occur in an environment that is very dirty
(ag applications) that direct charging may begin to have some difficulties being
as effective.
Other- Productivity. Charging of a vehicle battery could be done while parked
without the hassle or need to plug in or refuel assuming the time spent on the
charging bay is long enough and efficient enough to charge a battery enough for
the next length of travel.
