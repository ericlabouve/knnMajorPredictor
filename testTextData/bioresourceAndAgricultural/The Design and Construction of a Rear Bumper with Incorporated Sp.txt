ABSTRACT
This senior project outlines the design and construction of a rear bumper with
incorporated spare tire and equipment rack for a 1946 Willys CJ2A Jeep. The spare tire
rack is capable of swinging out away from the vehicle to allow for the use of the
vehicle’s tailgate. The bumper was designed for strength, functionality and aesthetic
qualities alike. Additionally, the bumper design considered all vehicle codes and
regulations.

INTRODUCTION
Prior to the engagement of the United States in World War II, the nation was tasked with
the production of war supplies including weapons and vehicles. In 1940, the Willys
Overland Company began production of a light duty general purpose vehicle known as
the “Jeep.” The jeep was the first four-wheeled vehicle of its kind and was designed to
transport troops and supplies over rugged terrain. The vehicle became a pivotal and
trustworthy tool to many soldiers on the war fronts. As the war came to an end, Willys
realized their war time vehicle could be introduced to the consumer vehicle market. The
vehicle was an immediate success when the CJ2A model made its market debut in 1945.
Figure 1 exhibits a Willy’s CJ2A. Over the years Willys evolved into Jeep, AMC and
eventually Chrysler all producing a number of different vehicle models. Today, there are
Jeep owners around the world who take pride in their four-wheel drive “grocery-getters.”

Figure 1. Alan Isaacson’s 1946 Willys CJ2A.

Alan Isaacson has been the proud owner of a 1946 CJ2A Willys jeep since 2010 and has
spent countless hours rebuilding and maintaining the vehicle. The vehicle sits in a stock
configuration including a side mounted tire and tailgate in rear which can be viewed in
Figure 2 and Figure 3. When this vehicle is used, it is often loaded with people and
supplies including fuel cans, a “Hi-Lift” jack and tool box; but space is limited. The
limited space is often uncomfortable and at times unsafe for occupants. Additionally, the
side mounted spare tire protrudes 12 inches beyond the side panel of the body making the
vehicle a total of 72 inches wide. Often when in operation, the jeep must be negotiated
through tight areas and therefore the operator must be mindful of the spare tire’s

2
proximity to objects along a trail as the tire can easily hit, snag or hang-up on hazards.
The spare tire’s location can be harmful to the occupants, the vehicle and the
environment because it can be easily snagged on trees and other foliage. To improve
upon this problem, the spare tire and equipment must be relocated. The only practical
option for storage in the current state is in the rear of the vehicle tub. Storage of
equipment in this area is not ideal and would limit the use of the removable rear seat.
Numerous aftermarket equipment companies have items available for purchase that
address storage and spare tire relocation. These items are marketed for many of the
modern vehicle models. Because of the age of this particular vehicle, there are few
industry solutions to this problem and therefore other means must be taken to construct a
device capable of fulfilling the owner’s needs.

Figure 3. Rear tailgate on a Willys CJ2A.

The objective of this project is to design and construct, based on similar aftermarket
solutions, a custom devise that relocates a 31 inch spare tire weighing 45 pounds and
allows for storage of an additional 70 pounds of equipment (including two fuel cans and a
“Hi-Lift” jack). See Figure 4 for a current aftermarket solution. The idea is to build a
custom rear bumper with an integrated spare tire mount and equipment storage rack for a
Willys CJ2A. This device will allow the spare tire and equipment to be relocated to the
rear of the vehicle allowing for occupant comfort and safety as well as vehicle clearance
and functionality. The tire is to be mounted on a rack with a heavy duty hinge that can
swing out of the way for the use of the tailgate. The tailgate hinges along the bottom rear
edge of the vehicle. To maintain the use of the tailgate, the rack must be capable of swing
out of the path of the tailgate; this requires at least 90 degrees of rotation by the rack
hinge. The rack itself must maintain a sufficient clearance (approximately 0.5 inches)
from the rear of the vehicle when in its closed position. The rack must have a locking/
latching system to hold its position in both the fully closed and fully opened position. The
bumper on which the rack mounts must reach from the driver’s side finder to the
passenger’s side fender and not protrude passed. The cost of the bumper is to not greatly
exceed $500.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Overview
When someone says off-roading one likely thinks Jeep. Jeep has been mastering rugged
terrain around the world since its birth in 1941(Allpar, 2015). Since its birth 75 years ago,
the past time of off-roading has greatly grown. From 1982 to 1995, participants in offroading increased 43.8% equating to a total of about 23 million people (Cordell, et. al.
1999). This number has continued to grow since 1995; with such interest many off road
vehicle accessories such as spare tire mount incorporated bumpers have emerged in the
market. The majority of these accessories are marketed for new model Jeeps, leaving few
options for the early models.
Testing
The U.S. Government and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA)
requires that all highway vehicles be fitted with a bumper that meets the 5 mph Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) impact Standard 581 (Evans and Haddad,
1983). A bumper is tested via two pendulum tests. These tests require that a dynamic
pendulum of identical curb weight strike a vehicle at the bumper’s foremost surface and
at the corners, and the vehicle must absorb the impact with no damage to the vehicle and
minimal to the bumper system (McCormick, 1991). These testing situations will be
considered during the design of the bumper and can me simulated in via a SolidWorks
analysis.
Materials
Passenger car bumper systems typically consist of a steel, aluminum, or reinforced plastic
bumper beam which spans the width of the vehicle (King et. al., 1993) but can also be
made of wood or composite materials such as carbon fiber. At times, numerous materials
are combined into a single bumper system. Although bumpers are designed to protect a
vehicle and its occupants from an impact, many aftermarket bumpers add other utilities
like towing hitches, spare tire mounts and equipment storage. Bumpers are constructed of
a wide variety of materials and these materials are selected based on the features of the
bumper and the characteristics the material provides.
Plastic . A common material of today’s bumper systems, plastic and large sections of
foam are often utilized in many small to medium cars, trucks and SUVs. These types of
bumpers maximize the weight to strength ratio while reducing cost and improving
aesthetic appeal. Plastic bumpers are not ideal in load bearing situations including the use
of tow packages or spare tire mount and therefore not ideal for larger trucks, off road
vehicles, or for the use in aftermarket bumpers with a spare tire mount. A plastic bumper
can be viewed in Figure 5.

5

Figure 5. A stock plastic bumper on a Toyota 4runner (Toyota, 2015).

Carbon Fiber . Carbon fiber, like plastic, maximizes the strength to weight ratio. Carbon
fiber utilizes millions of small fibers bonded together with an epoxy resin. These bumpers
are often very light weight, strong and non-flammable but can be brittle and quite pricey.
These types of bumpers are widely utilized on super cars or other applications where
weight is more important than the piece for the bumper itself (doityourself.com). An
image of a carbon fiber bumper can be viewed in Figure 6.

Figure 6. Carbon fiber bumper on a 2011 Austin Martin Vantage S (Top Speed, 2011).

Aluminum . Aluminum is becoming increasingly common in the automotive industry for
both body panels as well as bumpers. Ford is currently producing its F150 model with
fully aluminum body panels saving over 700 pounds from previous models (Ford, 2015).
Aluminum is much lighter but has similar strength characteristics when compared with

6
steel. Aluminum is corrosion resistant but requires special equipment and tools to work
with and additionally requires specific skills to fabricate, and therefore may be less
desirable for a “one-off” design. Aluminum is typically more expensive than steel. An
aluminum bumper can be viewed in Figure 7.

Figure 7. Aluminum bumper with spare tire mount on a jeep (Under Cover Fabworks,
2015).
Steel . Steel is a widely used material for both original equipment manufacturing and
aftermarket bumpers. Steel has a large weight bearing capacity, performs well with minor
to intermediate collisions, and is widely available and is easy to work with. Some
downsides of steel include that it has low corrosion resistance and is heavier than
aluminum. The majority of large trucks and utility vehicles use steel bumpers because
they perform well in collisions on and off-road. They also allow for the use of tow
packages and equipment storage and are easy to produce. An example of a steel bumper
can be viewed in Figure 8.

Figure 8. A steel bumper with spare tire mount installed on a modern jeep (Rugged
Ridge, 2015).

Design . There are many different spare tire mount incorporated bumper designs on the
market. The bumpers in Figure 8 and Figure 9 essentially perform the same task, but this
task is done with some significant differences. Publications like 4Wheel Drive Hardware
(2015) provide many design ideas. Ultimately, a bumper must be designed to meet the
characteristics, necessities and restraints of a specific vehicle while being safe and road
legal. Most of the current bumper designs utilize a cantilevered beam with a hub
assembly to allow for the spare tire to swing out of the way. Methods for the analysis of
such conditions can be found in AISC (2011), Budynas and Nisbett (2008) and Ryerson
Data Book (1975). These sources provide specific formulas and methods for correctly
sizing structural members by calculating the stresses produced under various conditions.
Potential conditions that must be analyzed include bending and shear stress in the
cantilevered beam, the spindle (pivot) and the bumper to frame mounts; view Figure 9 for
the identification of these items.

‘Jeep’ Universal (1965) provides many dimensions and drawings of early jeep vehicles.
Figure 7 provides an image of the frame and Table 1 provides frame specifications and
dimensions. This will prove useful in the sizing and shape of the bumper as well as how it
will attach to the frame. Aftermarket bumpers are often welded and therefore should
follow guidelines put for by the American Welding Society (2014). All bumpers must be
designed with the guidelines and requirements put for by NHSTA (2015), FMVSS and
SAE. Specific lamp standards for passenger vehicle bumpers are listed in Table 2.

Table 2. SAE lamp standards for automotive vehicles (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 1990).

A bumper of similar function and design was constructed by Morgan Defty, a Cal Poly
graduate of the BioResource and Agricultural Engineering Department. The bumper was
to include a spare tire mount and be fitted for a Chevy Suburban. The designs and
methods of Mr. Defty’s project will be referenced and considered in the construction of
the bumper at hand. A picture of Morgan Defty’s final product can be viewed in Figure 8.
There are some specific differences to note in the design of Mr. Defty’s bumper as
compared to the parameters of the design laid out in this report. First and foremost, Mr.
Defty’s bumper was designed for a vehicle much larger than a Willys CJ2A thus making
the over bumper design much larger as well. Additionally, the design in Figure 8 only
allows for the mounting of a spare tire and no equipment and is hinged on the driver’s
side. The design of this project is to incorporate the storage of a spare tire and equipment
(including fuel cans and a “Hi-Lift” jack) onto a bumper and have it hinge on the
passenger’s side of the vehicle.

PROCEDURES AND METHODS
Design
All design work for this bumper was conducted via SolidWorks, a 3D computer modeling
software. The design was driven by two main factors: 1) the size, shape and location of
the vehicle and its components to be equipped and 2) the size of the spare tire to be
mounted on the rack. Other factors also contributed to the design of the bumper
including: 1) ascetics, 2) location of license plate and tail lights, 3) location and function
of a latching system, 4) location of a receiver hitch, 5) incorporation of Jerry (fuel) cans
and 6) overall weight. Additionally, force calculations were conducted to ensure the
proposed bumper was safely and adequately built. The finished SolidWorks model can be
viewed in Figure 12 and Figure 13.

Figure 12. Completed SolidWorks model (transport position).

Figure 13. Completed SolidWorks model (tailgate access position).

12

Bumper . The bumper is the main body that spans the width of the vehicle that not only
protects the vehicle from impacts but also supports the spare tire rack. The bumper was
designed to mimic some of the characteristics of the stock bumper including tapering
outer end, see Figure 14. The bumper also had to incorporate a hitch receiver and be
capable of towing a small, single axle trailer. Flush mounted taillights were also desired.
To combine all of this into a single design, SolidWorks was utilized. In Figure 15, the
SolidWorks rendition exhibits tapering outer edges and cut outs for the taillights and
hitch receiver. To incorporate strength, save weight and maximize the number of
available metal working tools, 10 gauge (0.135”) sheet steel was chosen. The bumper was
designed to be cut out of a sheet of hot rolled 10 gauge via plasma cutter and then bent
into shape via press brake. The bumper flat pattern can be viewed in Figure 16. The
bumper was to be bent into a channel and because of this the constraints of the press
brake had to be considered. Because of such constraints, the bumper’s main channel was
sized to have a top flange of 5 inches, web of 5 inches and a bottom flange of 4 inches.
The bumper to frame mounts were designed to be made out of 0.25 inch plate and bolted
directly to the frame using two 0.5 inch bolts per mount.

Figure 14. A stock CJ2A rear bumper (G503, 2007).

Figure 15. SolidWorks rendition of bumper design.

13

Figure 16. Bumper flat pattern.
Spare Tire Rack . The spare tire rack is the device that allows for the mounting of a full
sized spare tire. It had to be designed so that the use of the vehicle’s rear tailgate would
not be limited. Additionally is had to incorporate mounts for Jerry (fuel) cans, the license
plate, and a latching system. The rack was designed to utilize a spindle – hub type
assembly that would allow the rack to swing open and out of the way when the use of the
vehicle’s tailgate was desired. A 2 inch x 3 inch x 0.125 inch tube was utilized as the
main body of the rack. A hub was placed on one side and the other side was tapered to fit
into a latching shelf. In the center of the tube, a riser and mounting flange was placed to
allow the spare tire to be bolted onto the rack. See Figure 17 for the rack design.

14

Figure 17. SolidWorks rendition of rack design.
Spindle – Hub Assembly . The spindle – hub assembly is designed to allow for the
swinging action of the rack enabling it to be moved out of the way when the use of the
vehicle’s tailgate is desired. The spindle was designed from a 1.25 inch diameter hot
rolled stock with 1 inch – NF – 14 threads cut to allow for a retaining nut. The hub was
produced from a piece of 2 inch DOM tubing with a 0.25 inch wall pressed fit oilimpregnated brass bushing. Grease passages were added in the spindle to allow for
lubrication between the spindle and the bushing. The spindle had to be correctly size to
be capable of withstanding the bending and shear forces produced by the weight and
movement of the rack including the spare tire and Jerry (fuel) cans. See Figure 21
through Figure 20 to view the spindle-hub assembly.

15

Figure 19. Exploded view of the spindle-hub assembly.

16

Figure 20. Cross-section view of the spindle-hub assembly.

Latching . Two different latching systems were designed for the rack. One system keeps
the rack in a “closed” position keeping it locked in a position parallel with the bumper.
The tapered end of the rack is designed to be lock within a shelf unit. This self prevents
any vertical or horizontal movement of the rack when locked. To lock the rack within the
shelf, a toggle clamp was used. See Figure 22. The second system uses a spring-loaded
pin that locks into place when the rack swing 122 degrees form the “closed” position to
the “open” position. The pin runs up a ramp and then falls into a locking slot. When the
rack is to be replaced to the “closed” position, the pin must be manually lifted out of the
slot unlocking the rack and allowing it to swing.
The latch “closed” design was designed to keep the rack locked in place when driving
down the road. Because failure of this latch could be catastrophic and harmful to motorist
or pedestrians, it was designed to handle large loads. The toggle clamp sized for this
application is rated for 500 pounds. The latch “open” design was designed to prevent the
rack from swinging toward the closed direction when this action was not desired.
Because the rack will see minimal loads when in this position, this latch was not designed
to handle large loads.

access) position.

Figure 22. Rack latching system for the closed (road transportation) position.

License Plate Mount . A mount was designed to allow the license plate to be bolted in
front of the spare tire using the spare tire studs. This location allows for proper visibility
of the license plate, protects the license plate from objects on the trail and doesn’t limit

18
the visibility of other items including the taillights. See Figure 23 for the placement and
design of the license plate mount.

Figure 23. License Plate Mount.

Design Analysis
Hand Calculations . A hand calculation was conducted to analyze the allowable and yield
load of the bumper. This test was set up as a simply supported beam analysis. To simplify
the analysis and find the “worst-case scenario,” the mid span cross-section of the bumper
design was taken as the uniform cross-section of the bumper in its entirety. Yield and
allowable stress were established as 36,000 psi and 15,000 psi respectively. It was
determined that the yield and allowable loads are 2200 pounds and 900 pounds
respectively. Additionally the maximum deflection caused by the allowable load was
determined to be 0.006 inches. SeeAPPENDIX B – Design Calculations and SolidWorks
FEA for the step by step analysis of the above.
SolidWorks FEA . SolidWorks offers a Fundamental Element Analysis simulation that
allows the user to apply various loading situations to a part or assembly. FEA was used to
analyze the main body of the bumper with a top load (straight down) of 900 pounds. This
analysis determined that the 900 pounds induced a 12,000 psi stress and 0.014 inches of
deflection at mid-span. These values are not far off from the hand calculations and the
discrepancy between the two is likely caused by small variations in the conditions of the
analysis including fixtures / supports and loading.
Additionally, FEA simulations were conducted on the bumper in a draft condition, the
Bumper to Frame Mounts and the Hub Spindle. See APPENDIX B – Design Calculations
and SolidWorks FEA for the SolidWorks FEA report for each simulation.

19

Construction
Bumper . The flat pattern of the bumper and rear plates was plasma cut from the 10 gauge
sheet. Flanges 3 and 4 were cut off of the flat pattern so the channel could be bent in the
press brake; see Figure 16. Bends at flanges 3 and 4 were not possible due to the
constraints of the press break. Flange 1 was bent before flange 2. See Figure 24 and
Figure 25 for a view of the channel made from bending flange 1 and 2. Once the channel
was bent, flanges 3 and 4 that were originally cut off of the flat pattern, were welded into
place. Additionally, the bumper mounting plates were plasma cut and welded into the
bumper channel along with the receiver tube, D-rings and additional channel flanges.
These can be viewed in Figure 26 and Figure 27. See

Rack . The main tube of the rack was cut to length and a fish mouth was cut into one side
to allow for the hub. A taper was cut on the opposing end of the tube allowing it to fit
within the latching structure. The hub was welded in and a cap was placed on the tapered
tube end. The riser was welded with gussets to the main tube and a plasma cut spare tire
flange was welded to the riser. The completed rack can be seen sitting on top of the
bumper in Figure 28. Gussets were added to the spare tire riser to counteract the bending
caused from the weight of the spare tire. Brackets were also added to the rear face of the
rack to all for the mounting of the Jerry (fuel) cans and can been seen in Figure 29. See
APPENDIX D – Rack Part and Assembly Drawings for all rack part and assembly
drawings and measurements.

Spindle – Hub Assembly . A shaft was machined to act as a spindle in the pivot
assembly. Threads were cut at the top of the spindle to allow for a retaining nut. A flat
was machined on one side of the threaded portion to allow for a locking “D-washer”.
Grease passages were also drilled to aid in the lubrication of the pivot. The hub was
constructed out of a piece of DOM tube with a press fit, oil-impregnated brass bushing.
The hub was welded to the fish mouthed end of the rack main tube and an additional
strap was welded around the hub and across the welded joint to strengthen this
connection. The bushing was machined on a lathe and pressed into the hub; see Figure

and assembly drawings and measurements.

Figure 32. Spindle – Hub assembly with thrust washers, retaining nut and grease zerk

Latching . The “closed” position latch used a stainless steel toggle clamp rated to 500
pounds of force. Stainless steel was chosen for its corrosion resistant properties. 500
pounds was seen as sufficient for this application. A shelf- type retaining structure was
constructed and holes had to be drilled and taped in both the rack main tube and shelf to
allow for the mounting of the toggle clamp. A Delrin plastic strip was added to the
tapered end of the rack tube allowing for a wear surface for when the rack engages with
the latching shelf. Close consideration had to be made in reference to the placement of
the toggle clamp so that the toggling characteristics of the clamp were maintained. The
toggle clamp and locking shelf can be viewed in Figure 34. The “open” position latch
used a pin with a weld on collar in which the pin would slide. Holes had to be drilled in
the pin to allow for retaining pins to be placed. The retaining pins hold the spring and the
locking pin in place within the collar. The locking ramp was welded onto the top flange
of the bumper and can be viewed in Figure 35. See APPENDIX D – Rack Part and
Assembly Drawings for all latching part and assembly drawings and measurements.

License Plate Mount . The License Plate Mount was constructed out of two plates and a
small tube spacer. The rear plate allowed for the mounting to the spare tire studs. The
front plate allowed for the mounting of the license plate and a small light to illuminate the
license plate at night. The tube was welded between the two plates allowing the mount to
fit within the offset of the rim. This mount is not structural and therefore the plates were
plasma cut out of 20 gauge sheet steel. See Figure 36 for the finished mount. See
APPENDIX D – Rack Part and Assembly Drawings for all license plate part and
assembly drawings and measurements.

28

Paint
All parts excluding any machined surfaces were chipped, sanded and wiped down with
acetone prior to being painted. All painted parts were painted with Rustoleum oil-base
enamel to prevent rust and add to the aesthetics of the finished product. All painted parts
were initially shot with two coats of primer. The overall look of the bumper was not to be
bright and flashy but rather to blend in and not reflect when on an off-road trail.
Olive . The two Jerry (fuel) cans were painted a flat olive color to resemble a military
issue type can. Black was not desired due to its thermal characteristics thus causing the
vaporization and expansion of the fuel inside.
Red . The “closed” and “open” positions latches were both painted red for their visibility
to the user. Red allows the user to quickly identify the points of input. The color red not
only sticks out against the black bumper but also signifies immediate user attention.
Black . The remainder of the parts, including the overall bumper and rack assemblies
were painted black to be consistent with the existing color scheme of the vehicle.
Additionally, black is more likely to blend in with a natural atmosphere.

Installation
The instillation occurred once all parts were painted and the necessary materials were
gathered. The instillation included the assembly of the bumper components, the assembly
of the rack components, the placement of the rack on the bumper, the bolting on of the
bumper assembly to the vehicle frame, instillation of the tail and flood lights and their
wiring, the mounting of the spare tire and Jerry (fuel) cans and the mounting of the
license plate and light. A trailer light pigtail was also wired in and mounted on the
underside of the bumper.
To mount the bumper to the frame, a forklift was used to align the bumper with respect to
the bodylines and frame rails of the vehicle. A hand drill was used to place holes in the
vehicle’s frame for the bumper mounting bolts. The bumper could then be mounted. Four
1/2 in. – NC – 2” bolts were used and tightened with a numeric impact driver.
The original bumper was removed for the purpose of the instillation of this project. The
original bumper and spare tire mount was weighed. Additionally the new bumper with
incorporated mount was weighed. The spare tire and Jerry (fuel) cans were not included
in the weight calculations. The weights were obtained by hanging the items from an
electronic load cell. The weight was recorded to ensure that the new bumper would not
overload the vehicle.

RESULTS
Appearance
The overall appearance of the finished bumper is aesthetically pleasing. The shape flows
well with the body lines. The paint scheme complements the existing scheme of the
vehicle. The new location of the tire provides improved the symmetry of the vehicle and
the tire is mounted parallel to the body. The license plate and tail lights have increased
visibility. See Figure 49 thru Figure 53 for images of the completed design.

Functionality
The overall vehicle functionality and ability has improved because of the new bumper.
The bumper allows for the storage of an additional ten gallons of fuel, allowed the
vehicle to sit level due to the placement of the spare tire in the center of the vehicle and
makes the overall width twelve inches smaller allowing for increased maneuverability.
The spare tire no longer sticks out where it can catch or snag on objects. Additionally, the
bumper did not hinder the use of the tailgate. The spare tire rack latches and unlatches
from the opened and closed positions easily and firmly. The rack swings well and easily
across its entire range of movement.
As a real life proof of concept, an applied force test was conducted on the bumper. While
the front of the vehicle was anchored to a heavy object, a come-along was hooked to a
hitch placed in the bumper receiver. The opposite end of the come-along was anchored to
the ground. A load cell was also added between the bumper and the come-along. The
come-along was used to apply a force of 1200 pounds at an angle of 10 degrees from the
ground to the hitch resulting in a vertical down load of 208 pounds and a draft load of
1180 pounds. This test was designed to simulate the loading conditions that would occur
from towing a small trailer or the removal of a stuck vehicle. The test resulted in the
suspension compressing half of an inch with no other measureable deflection of the
bumper itself. See Figure 55 thru Figure 57 for images of the applied force test.

42

Figure 55. Jeep anchored at front to forklift for applied force test.

Figure 56. Jeep anchored at back to dead-man via come-along.

43

Figure 57. Load cell installed to take force measurements.

With the spare tire rack in the open position, 200 pounds was applied to the end of the
rack tube. This force resulted in a compression of the suspension and an increased gap
between the body and the bumper. This gap was not caused by a deflection in the bumper
but rather from a deflection in the frame rail of the vehicle. It appears the bumper is
stronger than the strength of the vehicle frame.

44
DISCUSSION
A major consideration in the bumper design was strength. The bumper had to be able to
support weight cantilevered out on the spare tire rack and a trailer hooked to the receiver.
The vehicle manufacture lists that maximum pay load as 800 pounds and the maximum
continuous drawbar pull as 1200 pounds. The bumper produced is capable of such loads
although a stronger bumper may be desired for more strenuous conditions. Some factors
that limit the strength of the current design include the material thickness and the lack of
plating on the backside of the bumper channel at mid span. Plating was not added in this
area to allow access to the pinning hole of the receiver tube. The tapering of the bumper
channel at mid span can also be identified as a limiting factor because this reduces the
area moment of inertia.
Initial designs included a mount for a Hi-Lift jack and a rack for the storage of an ice
chest or other equipment. Later designs eliminated a Hi-Lift mount and storage rack
because space was limited. The jack and rack would have added more weight to the
bumper and were not seen as extremely necessary.
When the rack is loaded down with full Jerry (fuel) cans and a spare tire the rack slides
into the latching shelf easily. When the Jerry (fuel) cans are empty, the rack does not
engage with the latching shelf straight on because the reduced load causes less deflection
of the main rack tube and therefore more force must be applied to place the rack fully
within the latching shelf.
The ending cost of the bumper was $384 but this did not include labor. Although this is a
custom one-off design, in terms of productivity, to make this bumper rival similar designs
in the market place, the cost will likely need to be reduced to be competitive.
The overall look of the bumper is very pleasing however the paint does show some
imperfections. These imperfections include runs and ruff surface finish. The runs are
caused by too thin of paint or too thick off application during painting and the ruff
surface is attributed to the fact that the bumper was painted outdoors under a tree where
pollen and other plant debris fell upon the wet paint.

45
RECOMMENDAITONS
To improve upon the overall strength of the bumper design thicker material could be
used. Plating the back of the channel at mid span would help as well. A deeper or wider
channel could also be produced. The three options listed above would increase the area
moment of inertia and decrease the stress and deflection. Although the bumper could
withstand larger loads, the overall max loading of the vehicle must be considered as well.
Although the Hi-Lift Jack was not included in this design, it could replace one of the
Jerry (fuel) can. An adapter plate could be produced that adapts the Jerry (fuel) can
mounting holes to those of the Hi-Lift. This would decrease the amount of fuel storage
and overall weight and increase variability. An alternative would be to build a new
bumper with a winch that incorporates a Hi-Lift Jack mount as well.
To prevent the variation in the alignment of the rack tube within the latching shelf, a
thicker walled tube or taller tube could be used to increase the area moment of inertia and
decrease the deflection. Although the rack will engage with the latching shelf under all
conditions, it would be nice for the rack to simply glide into place rather than forcedly
pushing it so.
To decrease cost and increase productivity if this bumper were to be massed produced,
plasma cutting all parts to exact dimensions as well as setting up for mass production
runs with equipment designed for such would significantly reduce the amount of labor
involved with producing such a product. Fixtures and templates could be made allowing
for swift and accurate production.
To improve the finish quality of the paint, it is recommended that more attention to detail
be paid to the thinning of the paint. This will decrease the occurrence of paint runs.
Additionally, painting in a paint booth out of the elements would allow for a smoother,
more professional finish. To improve upon the overall appearance of the bumper, powder
coating should be considered. Although the cost increases, the labor time decreases and
the finish quality increases.

APPENDIX A – How this Project Meets Requirements for the BRAE Major

49

Major Design Experience
The BRAE senior project must incorporate a major design experience. Design is the
process of devising a system, component, or process to meet specific needs. The design
process typically includes fundamental elements as outlined below. This project
addresses these issues as follows.
Establishment of Objectives and Criteria. Project objectives and criteria are
established to meet the needs and expectations of the owner as well as meet the
regulations and laws put out by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) and Department of Transportation (DOT). See Design Parameters and
Constraints below for specific objectives and criteria for the project.
Synthesis and Analysis. The project incorporates bending stress and displacement
calculations of the main bumper member design, and the consideration of alternative
materials and designs.
Construction, Testing and Evaluation. The bumper was designed, constructed and
evaluated under varying conditions.
Incorporation of Applicable Engineering Standards. The project utilizes AISC
standards for allowable bending stresses and National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration regulations for license plate and taillight locations and bumper strength.
Capstone Design Experience
The BRAE senior project is an engineering design project based on the knowledge and
skills acquired in earlier coursework (Major, Support and/or GE courses). This project
incorporated knowledge/ skills from these key courses.
 BRAE 129 Lab Skills/Safety
 BRAE 133 Engineering Graphics/Drafting
 BRAE 151 AutoCAD
 BRAE 152 SolidWorks
 BRAE 234 Mechanical Systems
 BRAE 421/422 Equipment Engineering
 ME 211/212 Engineering Statics/Dynamics
 CE 204/207 Strength of Materials
 ENGL 149 Technical Writing
Design Parameters and Constraints
This project addresses the categories and constraints listed below.
Physical. The bumper was required to mount directly to the vehicle, incorporate a spare
tire mount for a 29 inch tire that allowed for the use of the vehicle’s tailgate and allowed

50
for the mounting of “Jerry (fuel) cans,” a “Hi-Lift” jack and have a hitch receiver. The
completed bumper is bolted directly to the frame of the vehicle, accommodates Jerry cans
and a 31 inch tire. The design did not accommodate a Hi-Lift jack mount. The bumper
spans the width of the vehicle and does not protrude passed or rub on the body of the
vehicle.
Economic. The cost of project was to not greatly exceed $500. The total cost of the
project excluding the cost of labor was $384.
Environmental. Moving the spare tire to the rear of the vehicle will reduce the
destruction of brush and shrubs when the vehicle is in use by reducing the overall width
of the vehicle. The overall width of the vehicle is now 12 inches narrower.
Sustainability. Modifications to this vehicle will make it more suited to the owner and
prevent the owner from selling the old vehicle and replacing it with a new one. The
owner has found the vehicle more useful and better suited to his needs.
Manufacturability. Although this is a one-off design, the physical constraints of the
design and the equipment at hand had to be considered during the design. Through use of
a CNC plasma cutter the time required to manufacture this bumper was reduced. The
bumper channel was also sized so it could be accommodated in a press break. If this had
not been conducted, the channel would have had to be outsourced.
Health and Safety. The bumper had to be designed based on restrictions and regulations
put forth by the NHTSA and DOT for public safety both on and off-road. The bumper
has been built to sustain a 10 mph collision per NHTSA regulations, has allocated DOT
certified tail lights and license plate lights and lights and the license plate have been
located for proper visibility.
Ethical. The construction of this bumper was to employ ethical safety factors at the
probability of increased expense to ensure that the product is safely designed. The
bumper was design with a loading safety factor of 2.4. These calculations were conducted
using a simply supported beam analysis and SolidWorks Fundamental Element Analysis.
Social. The construction of this bumper may affect the construction of similar products in
the future which could cause a surge in the market in terms of sales and employment.
Although the bumper has been recently completed, some jeep enthusiasts have been
interested in the design and availability of such a bumper.
Political. The reduced destruction in wildlife by relocating the rear tire was to help ease
the controversy between environmentalists and four-wheel drive enthusiasts. The vehicle
is now 12 inches narrower and therefore is less destructive to wildlife along off-road
trails. This reduction in destruction will likely improve the look of four-wheel drive
enthusiasts in the public eye.

51
Aesthetics. The finished product was to be painted with a paint gun utilizing high quality
black enamel. The bumper was painted with black enamel which produced a pleasing
look.
Other – Design. The design must allow for easy access to the rear tailgate by employing
a hinge and latching system. The bumper incorporated a rear rack to which the spare tire
was mounted. The rack is capable of swinging 122 degrees which allows access to the
tailgate.
