1. Abstract
This presentation contains an assessment of the best overall corrosion monitoring device,
intrusive or non-intrusive, for use in the petrochemical industry. Corrosion in the petrochemical
industry is a large issue because it causes a deterioration of pipe integrity in fuel processing
systems. A reduction of pipe wall integrity due to corrosion could result in a leak or an explosion
of fuel processing lines since those systems function at high pressures. The use of corrosion
monitoring systems in the petrochemical industry helps to detect early signs of corrosion prior to
failure so that proper maintenance can be performed to prevent catastrophe. To simulate those
types of systems a test cell was designed to adequately fit two corrosion monitoring devices.
Each device determines corrosion rate by measuring pipe wall thickness over time using
ultrasonic technology or by measuring resistance across a degrading reference element. The
corrosive medium used to corrode the inside of the test cell is glacial acetic acid (>99.7% purity).
Measurements of pipe wall thickness were taken before and after testing and are used as a
reference point to compare against each device‚Äôs measurement. Relative accuracy, response time,
safety, and reliability are used as criteria for determining the best monitoring device. Overall, the
Microcor ER probe proved to be the better of the two devices as determined by the criteria listed
above and the time allowed for testing.

2. Background
Corrosion Background
Corrosion is a chemical or electrochemical reaction between a material, usually a metal, and its
environment that invokes a deterioration of a material and its properties [1]. Environmental
factors that induce the deterioration of a material include a combination of physical state (liquid,
gas, or solid), chemical composition, and temperature. Once a material has deteriorated
extensively enough, it will fail. Depending on the application, this could cause major issues. For
example, a severely corroded fuel pipeline could spring a leak or explode because the system is
at such a high pressure. As a result, there would be a major monetary loss from halt of
production or even serious injury/death to on-site personnel.

Corrosion Monitoring Equipment: Intrusive ER Probes
All facilities that transport corrosive mediums must have various corrosion monitoring systems
installed throughout their pipeline network to detect and provide accurate information on the
integrity of the wall thicknesses. These systems work to provide critical information on the rate
of corrosion which can be further used to increase the cost effectiveness of plant operations. The
cost effectiveness of plant operations can be increased since the devices provide data on
corrosion trends associated with changes in process parameters. These in turn aid in identifying a
specific corrosion problem, assess the effectiveness of corrosion prevention techniques, and
generate interpretive data for maintenance requirements [2]. Facilities have several variations of
monitoring systems available to choose from, but the two most common monitoring systems are
intrusive electrical resistance (ER) probes and non-intrusive automated thickness monitoring
(ATM) systems [2]. Both methods are effective in providing accurate and reliable data on the

3

corrosion rates, but as effective as each system is, there are drawbacks that have to be
considered.

Intrusive ER probes function by exposing an element on the probe head to the corrosive fluid and
measuring the resistance across that exposed element. The reduction in the element‚Äôs crosssection will be proportional to the increase in the electrical resistance of the element, given by
equation 1:
ùêø

ùëÖ = ùëü‚àó( )
ùê¥

(1)

R representing the electrical resistance, r being the specific resistance of the given material, L
being the element length, and A being the cross sectional area. ER probes are characterized as an
intrusive method because it requires a direct insertion of the probe into the pipeline to expose it
to the corrosive medium. An access fitting hole is drilled into the pipe with a specific diameter to
accommodate the device plus special mounting flanges that have to be bored and welded to
ensure a seamless fit after installation . The main drawback for this system is that the probes
have a finite lifespan of about 3 years and the replacement process has proven to be a high-risk
task and at times even fatal due to the high pressure environments they are installed in [3].

Despite its drawbacks, ER probes have remained the gold standard for measuring corrosion rate
since they have proved to be highly accurate and reliable in measuring corrosion rate. As a result
of their high use, there has been substantial development into the variations of probe head type
and probe design. Probe design variations include fixed, retractable, and retrievable probes[3].
Fixed probes are screwed or bolted into the pipelines, resulting in the pipeline being shut off

4

during installation or removal. This allows access to the ER probe head and will prevent any
serious accidents. Retractable probes are more advanced than fixed probes in that they feature a
safer retractable system for replacement or removal of the probe head. Specifically, there is a
locking ferrule and an adjustable safety chain that function in concert with each other to prevent
the probe from shooting out during replacement (Figure 1). However, these variants are usually
only designed for lower pressure piping systems. On the other hand, retrievable probes are
installed with special fittings and modifications to account for monitoring at high pressures
(Figure 1)[3].

Figure 1. Typical designs for a retractable (left) and retrievable (right) corrosion monitoring ER
probe variant. [http://www.alspi.com/erintro.htm]

The various head types (exposed elements) available vary greatly depending on the type of
system it will function in (Figure 2). Each head type is designed to be chosen based on the need
for probe life and probe response time [3]. Variations include:

5

1. Wire loop: most common, high sensitivity, equipable velocity shield
2. Cylindrical: welded reference tube inside of tube element, suited for harsher
environments
3. Tube loop: high sensitivity applications, rapidly detect low corrosion rates
4. Strip loop: flat loop geometry, low flow applications
5. Spiral loop: high-flow applications, high resistance means high signal-to-noise ratio ‚Üí
sensitive
6. Flush mount (large/small): flush with vessel wall, effective in simulating true corrosion,
used in pigging operations with high velocity systems
7. Atmospheric/Surface strip: large surface area exposed element, ideal for measurements in
inhomogeneous corrosive environments

Corrosion Monitoring Equipment: Non-Intrusive Ultrasonic Sensors
The variety of non-destructive ATM systems that can safely and efficiently measure the
corrosion rate of pipelines vary depending on the requirements. However, the primary focus of
this literature review will be placed on fixed ultrasonic thickness monitoring (UTM) systems.
UTM systems function to measure a localized thickness through the use of sound waves. UTM
systems normally include a transducer, pulser/receiver, and a display [5]. The type of transducer
used for this application is the ultrasonic transducer, which can either be piezoelectric or variable
capacitive [6]. The pulser generates short electric pulses of energy at a constant rate which are
converted by the transducer into short high frequency ultrasonic sound pulses [7]. These pulses
are then directed into the material, any discontinuation or impurity in the path of the ultrasonic
sound wave will be reflected by the impurities surface to be received by the transducer,
transformed into an electric signal, and amplified by the receiver to be projected onto the display
(Figure 3). Depending on the intensity shown on the display, information about the
impurity/discontinuity such as size, orientation, and location can be accurately derived [5].
One such procedure was conducted by the Ship Materials Engineering Department of the Naval
Surface Warfare Center detailing the process thoroughly: After mechanical measurements were
made using either a deep throat micrometer and calipers. The resulting thickness information was
used to determine which sections on the piping would be tested to acquire a desired thickness.
All of the ultrasonic measurements were made at the center of the grid location of interest. For
the four thickness gages evaluated, the transducer used was the one recommended by the
manufacturer for measurements in the thickness range of interest [8].

l]

These types of monitoring systems have an accuracy up to +/-0.01 mm on metallic materials
(varies depending on metal type) and can provide accurate readings with metal thicknesses
ranging from 3 mm up to 50 mm [9]. UTM systems do not require access to both sides of the
sample to measure thickness and can measure thickness over a layer of paint up to 1.0 mm thick
without damaging it. The types of UTM systems available are permanently installed fixed and
permanently installed magnetically mounted. The fixed and magnetic UTM systems have the
capacity to wirelessly transmit data to a computer through a network of sensors and a gateway.
The fixed sensor can be permanently mounted on the pipeline by a clamp or studs welded onto
the pipe [10]. This allows for mounting orientation in the vertical position or horizontal to the
ground. As long as it maintains good contact with the surface it will provide highly accurate data
to the user. The magnetic sensor is mounted magnetically and fastened by a strap around the pipe
allowing for multiple sensors to be attached on that same strap around the same pipe [10- 11].
Some of the drawbacks that come with the use for both systems is the inaccuracy of measuring a

8

layer of rust and the frequent replacement of the battery. Additionally, both types require
seamless contact with the metal and requires trained personnel to interpret data [4].

Cause for ER Probe Alternatives
ER Probes have been used by the oil and gas industry since the 1960‚Äôs due to their reliability and
effectiveness in pipe thickness monitoring [3]. However, due to sensing elements being a
consumable in nature they have a finite lifetime and have to be replaced periodically. Requiring a
dangerous removal and replacement process in a high pressure environment, which includes a
probability of the probes ejecting at high velocity due to residual pressure in the pipes.
Unfortunately, over the years there have been multiple cases of severe injury due to the
unavoidable replacement procedures [3]. As a result, considerable research has been done to
effectively improve safety by redesigning the model or by placing more emphasis on the use of
non-intrusive methods which theoretically output the same effectiveness and reliability as ER
Probes. The importance of non-intrusive designs is to provide a safer means of measuring
corrosion rate inside the pipeline. One key benefit to mention is its improved ease-of-use, due to
its fixed design variants [12]. A technician can easily measure the thickness of pipes across the
plant in roughly a minute. The recent push towards automated non-intrusive forms of thickness
monitoring is slowed by the concern that the alternatives might not be as reliable as ER Probes.

3. Experimental Procedure
Design Considerations
A test cell is designed to simulate high corrosion conditions similar to those found in fuel
processing lines minus the high pressures, temperatures, and external environmental conditions.

9

To replicate the corrosive conditions found in fuel processing systems two types of system were
considered: dynamic and static. The dynamic system that was considered consisted of a
corrosion resistant pump to pump a corrosive medium through a circular system of PVC Type I
pipes and through a test section at low velocity (Figure 4). In addition to that, the design also
included two access valves where the corrosive medium could be drained or filled. The corrosive
medium would be pumped at a low velocity to reduce the possible effects of erosion corrosion.
Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the build and strict time constraints, this system was
dropped for a similar design.

Figure 4. Dynamic low flow system considered to replicate a corrosive environment found in fuel
processing systems (Test section = red circle, access valves = blue circle, pump = green circle).

An alternative to the dynamic system is a static system in which the devices are attached or
inserted into a plain carbon steel pipe that is sealed on one end and filled with a corrosive
medium. The ultrasonic monitoring device would be magnetically attached to the outside while
the ER Probe would be attached directly via an access fitting to the exterior of the pipe. Each

10

sensor is subsequently connected to either a tablet or laptop where the corrosion data can be
obtained (Figure 5).

Draining and Cleaning
See Appendix A.1 Draining

4. Results
Post testing the probe recorded an estimated material loss on the pipe wall of 0.07 mils within a
79 hour test period. The ET-210 sensor, on the other hand, recorded a total of 0 mils of pipe loss
for the duration of the initial testing period, data collected from both can be seen in Table I. It‚Äôs
important to note that the probe readings do not indicate a direct measurement but merely an
estimation based on how much material the reference element loses while submerged in the
acetic acid.

The Microcor ER Probes trendline has a moderate rise in detected metal loss with the slope being
close to 1 at around ~9.447, while the ET-210 WiHart Sensor has a slope of exactly 1. Both
devices, indicated a linear trend of corrosion with relatively minimal scatter (Figure 6).

Figure 6. Data showing metal loss over time measured by the two devices.

Post testing, additional wall thickness measurements were taken at 27 locations over 3 cross
sections of the test cell and averaged. The first cross section being 2 inches from the bottom, the
second being 7 inches from the bottom, and the third being 13 inches from the bottom. Once
those 27 measurements are averaged it is shown that the ET-210 WiHART sensor measured a
total wall thickness loss of 3.67 mils (Figure 7).

5. Discussion
During the duration of testing, the ER probe showed a fairly linear trend of data while the ET210 sensor showed no change in pipe wall thickness. An explan for this lack of readings includes
the sensor not functioning properly. Another possibility is that since the ET-210 sensor is fixed
in a single position during the testing period, it measured pipe wall loss and corrosion product
buildup simultaneously, resulting in the wall loss and corrosion build up canceling each other
out. Which is expected in some form due to the nature of the static system in which the devices
were tested in. As it stands, the data gathered from initial testing was wholly inconclusive mainly
due to the short testing period and the corrosion build up.
Table II lays out several logistical aspects that were not a part of the main criteria used to
influence the verdict. However, provided additional information to the logistical use of each
device and can be treated as secondary criteria. With that being said, logistically, the ET-210
sensor tends to be somewhat easier to maintain, due to its non-intrusive nature.

6. Conclusion
Taking all of the literature, device specifications, and available data into account, it is determined
that the Microcor ER probe is the superior of the two devices based on points awarded from the
initial criteria.

In terms of overall safety, the ET-210 sensor surpassed its counterpart in this category due to its
non-intrusive nature in that the sensor is magnetically attach to outside of the pipe wall. In
addition to only requiring a battery replacement every 6.5 years. While the ER probe takes an
intrusive approach for installation. Which makes it more hazardous to operate and maintain and
often times in a large scale refinery setting these devices can prove to be dangerous or fatal. The
reason being that the devices are installed in pipelines subject to high pressure and velocity fluids
running through them, often at elevated temperatures. Points for this criteria can be seen in Table
III.

17

A response time ‚Äúpoint‚Äù is given to the Microcor ER Probe while zero points were awarded to
the ET-210 sensor. Since over the course of 79 hours the Microcor ER Probe outputted mil loss
readings. Whilst the ET-210 WiHART Sensor outputted a zero change in wall thickness over the
same time period. However, it worth mentioning that the data each device collected had a close
to linear trendline and experienced relatively little scatter. Points for this criteria can be seen in
Table III.

As far as reliability is concerned, the probe proved to be more reliable than the ET-210 sensor,
due to the simple fact that the probe yielded readings indicating a change in pipe wall thickness
while the ET-210 sensor did not. Points for this criteria can be seen in Table III.

It is important to note that because a true physical measurement of pipe wall thickness proved to
be more difficult than previously theorized, it is assumed that both devices performed accurately
based on their respective technical specifications and measurement methods. Thus accuracy was
not a heavily weighted criteria that influenced the final verdict. Points for this criteria can be
seen in Table III.

The verdict that was decided however does not discount the effectiveness and utility of the ET210 sensor. Further testing is needed to confirm whether the ER probe is truly superior to the ET210 sensor.

7. Future Recommendations
For future testing it is recommended that an extend the testing period is the best option, ideally
testing should last about 4 weeks. Anything less than 2 weeks might be too short to yield any
sufficient data. Additionally, modifying the test cell design from static to dynamic, choosing a
different corrosive medium, and or attaching multiple ET-210 sensors to the outside of the test
section might yield a more complete and conclusive comparison of these two devices. It is
possible that all of the aforementioned recommendations could in some way shape or form affect
the data acquisition of further testing.
