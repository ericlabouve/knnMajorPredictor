Abstract
Silver and silver-based products are known to cause cytotoxic effects to both microbes and
eukaryotic cells. Because of this property, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are being studied for their
potential in targeted tumor treatments. Previous studies with microbes suggest that AgNPs with
cationic capping agents possess enhanced cytotoxicity by virtue of Coulombic attraction between
the nanoparticle and the negatively-charged cell wall. Since animal cells possess similar
negatively-charged plasma membranes, this research hypothesized that human cells would be
more susceptible to positively-charged AgNPs than to negatively-charged AgNPs. To investigate
this theory, cancerous cervical cells (HeLa) and healthy fibroblast cells (3T3) were subjected to
treatments of 40 nm diameter AgNPs with branched polyethylenimine (AgBPEI, ζ = + 69 mV)
and citrate (AgCit, ζ = - 49 mV) capping agents. AgNO3 was also tested to compare AgNP toxicity
to that of ionic silver (Ag+). An alamarBlue® viability assay was used to quantify the cytotoxicity
of the treatments relative to an untreated control group. AgBPEI displayed a lower LD50 than did
Ag+ and AgCit to both cell lines. This suggests AgNP toxicity is not solely from Ag+ dissolution,
and also ostensibly supports the initial hypothesis. However, significant AgCit aggregation was
observed in culture media, which obfuscates surface charge-based toxicity effects because larger
diameter AgNPs are less cytotoxic. Thus size-dependent toxicity must also be considered, although
this is not expected to negate surface charge effects. Moreover, since AgBPEI is more stable than
AgCit under in vitro conditions, these results suggest that researchers investigating AgNPs for
targeted tumor treatments should utilize AgBPEI over AgCit on the premise of enhanced
biovailability.

Introduction

A. Background

Nanosilver, or silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), are silver particles that do not exceed 100 nanometers
in any dimension. Within a medical context, AgNPs are known for their anti-bacterial, anti-fungal,
anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory [1] properties. For example, AgNPs are used as germicidal agents
in everyday items such as socks, cosmetics, washing machines, food packaging, water
disinfectants, sponges, and toothbrushes [2]. AgNPs are also increasingly used in the biomedical
field for diagnostics and imaging, wound dressings, and medical device coatings [3], and are
recently being investigated for their potential4as therapeutic5agents6for tumor7treatments [4-8].
Because targeted tumor treatments hope to isolate and selectively destroy cancerous tissue, they
offer a potentially enormous advantage over the widespread side effects caused by traditional
chemotherapy methods.
B. Problem Statement
The continually increasing list of applications of AgNPs necessitates a deeper understanding of
the way in which nanosilver interacts with biological matter. However, the relative novelty of
silver nanotechnology has limited definitive conclusions and consensus within the scientific
community. For example, research into the consequences of long-term exposure to nanosilver by
both humans and the environment is ongoing; the only thing agreed upon is that silver
nanomaterials should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis [9] and that cytotoxic effects are
contingent on their physicochemical properties [10]. Most researchers agree that while the release
of Ag+ ions is the predominant mechanism of cytotoxicity, this alone does not account for the
totality of the biological response to AgNPs, and that other nanoparticle-specific mechanisms exist
[10,11]
. These cytotoxic mechanisms may be aided or hindered by altering the size, shape, and
surface properties of13AgNPs [12-14]. It is within this context, and encouraged by current interest in
AgNPs for cancer treatments, that the effect of AgNP surface charge on cytotoxic efficacy is being
studied in this work.
C. Hypothesis
While research indicates that surface charge plays a pivotal role in the cytotoxicity of AgNPs on
prokaryotes [14], little is known about the eukaryotic response to AgNP surface charge. Since
eukaryotic cells are surrounded by a negatively-charged phospholipid membrane, it is expected
that AgNPs with cationic capping agents will display superior cytotoxicity over anionic capping
agents by virtue of increased nanoparticle interaction. This trend was explicitly pointed out in a
2013 study that measured cytotoxicity of different AgNPs towards planktonic crustacean samples
[15]
, which share similar animal cell membrane physiology with humans. Further study—especially
with human cells—is required before categorical inferences about surface charge dependent
cytotoxicity in eukaryotes can be made. If this hypothesis holds true, then this discovery may be
of value to those developing AgNPs for targeted tumor treatments. In other words, utilizing
positively charged capping agents may enhance the efficacy of silver nanoparticles in killing
cancerous cells.

2

D. Literature Review
AgNPs engender cytotoxic effects in both microbes and eukaryotic cells through a variety of
mechanisms. These include: activation of cell signaling pathways, which can inhibit proliferation
[16]
; damage to cellular constituents, such as destabilization of the cell membrane or mitochondria
[11]
; induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondrial dysfunction [17], which can
initiate DNA fragmentation, chromosomal aberrations, and ultimately cell cycle arrest and/or
apoptosis [12,18]; direct interruption of the electron transport chain, subsequent metabolic arrest, and
hindered viability [11]; and lastly AgNP endocytosis and subsequent Ag+ ion release into the
cytoplasm, which attacks thiol-containing proteins and binds with chlorine ligands [19]. These
mechanisms are graphically summarized in Figure 1. It should be noted that the severity of these
deleterious effects are contingent on a variety of factors, ranging from nanoparticle size, shape,
and surface properties to environmental stability and bioavailability to the target cell, cell type,
and duration of cell exposure [20].

Figure 1. Proposed AgNP toxicity mechanisms on animal cells [16].

Because cytotoxic AgNPs can be functionalized to specifically target tumor cells, they are being
studied by cancer researchers [4-8]. AgNPs have been found to be preferentially cytotoxic to cancer
cells over healthy cells because cancerous cells have impaired DNA repair pathways, making them
more susceptible to ROS-mediated genotoxicity [18]. Moreover, the tumor environment is more
acidic than healthy cells, which may encourage silver ion dissolution and engender further
preferential toxicity [8].

3

Although an investigation into the exact mechanisms in which silver nanoparticles cause cancerous
cell death is beyond the scope of this work, it is feasible to isolate and study a single parameter of
AgNP tumor treatments. In 2011, El Badawy et al. found that AgNPs grafted with cationic polymer
branched polyethylenimine (AgBPEI) were more cytotoxic to Bacillus species than those grafted
with anionic citrate (AgCit) [14]. It was speculated that this was the result of Coulombic attraction
between the positive surface charge of the AgBPEI and the negative surface charge of teichoic
acids in the peptidoglycan cell wall of Bacillus microbes. This hypothesis was supported by a 2013
study where AgBPEI was more toxic than AgCit to E.coli microbes with similar Gram negative
cell wall compositions as Bacillus species. Atomic force microscopy was performed to illustrate
the outcome of enhanced AgBPEI interaction with the microbes’ cell walls (Figure 2) [10]. Because
of this enhanced interaction, cytotoxic effects—regardless of mechanism—were increased. This
trend was independently confirmed by researchers studying the influence of AgNP surface charge
in other microbial treatments [15,21], showing that surface charge is influential in the cytotoxicity of
AgNPs on prokaryotes.

Figure 2. Atomic force microscope images showing AgCit (left) and AgBPEI (right) interacting with E.
coli cells. Significantly more AgBPEI is deposited on E. coli cell walls than AgCit. The scale bar denotes 1
micron [10].

However, mammalian cell response to changes in AgNP surface charge is unknown. Mammalian
cells possess a negatively charged phospholipid membrane [22,23], so it is not unreasonable to
speculate that AgNPs with positively-charged capping agents will interact with and kill
mammalian cells more so than those with negatively-charged capping agents. In support of this
hypothesis, it was found that gold nanoparticles with cationic coatings displayed significantly more
interaction with a model cell membrane than those with anionic coatings [24]. Should this
hypothesis hold, it would be of particular interest in regards to cancer cells, which have a more
negative surface charge than healthy cells [22,25]. A 2013 study into the ecotoxicity of AgNPs with
varying capping agents revealed that the eukaryote Daphnia magna, a planktonic crustacean, was
indeed more susceptible to AgBPEI (ζ = +28.8 mV, pH 7.1) treatments than AgCit treatments (ζ
= -20.08 mV, pH 7.2) [15]. Considering both crustaceans and humans share the same general animal
cell physiology, a similar cytotoxic response to AgNP surface charge should be observed.

4

E. Design of Experiment
Cancerous HeLa cells and healthy 3T3 fibroblast cells were subjected to AgNP treatments of
varying surface charge and concentration. The AgNPs were spherical, of identical diameter, and
sterilized to limit confounding cytotoxic effects of shape, size, and biological contaminants. To
achieve AgNPs with opposite surface charge, branched polyethylenimine (BPEI) and citrate (Cit)
were chosen as AgNP capping agents—each of which was tested as a cytotoxicity control. Also
tested was silver nitrate (AgNO3) to provide comparison to the cytotoxicity of ionic silver (Ag+).
Cytotoxicity testing was performed via the alamarBlue® viability assay. Lethal dose 50% (LD50)
values were calculated to quantify cytotoxicity trends. Cell culture morphology was inspected with
light microscopy before and after treatment to detect contamination and to ensure culture growth.
Lastly, the nanoparticles were characterized for diameter and size distribution with dynamic light
scattering (DLS) to verify nanoparticle stability in media. Transmission electron microscope
(TEM) images and zeta potential data for the AgNPs were collected from the manufacturer to
ensure product quality.
Once the data was collected, the response of healthy and cancerous human cells to oppositely
charged AgNPs could be compared and screened against BPEI, Cit, and Ag+ ions. If results show
that AgBPEI is more cytotoxic than AgCit, and neither the negative controls nor the aggregation
study indicate confounding affects, conclusions regarding the influence of surface charge on
cytotoxicity can be made. It may then also be beneficial to utilize cationic capping agents over
anionic capping agents for future AgNP cancer research and other inherent toxicity applications.
F. Objective(s)
This study endeavored to explicitly determine if positively-charged AgNPs are more cytotoxic
than negatively-charged AgNPs when applied to both healthy and cancerous human cells. To do
so, the cytotoxicity of positively-charged, cation-capped AgNPs (ζ > 0) was compared to that of
negatively-charged, anion-capped AgNPs (ζ < 0). This was done in hopes of finding a more
suitable AgNP for targeted tumor research.
This experiment was setup in a way that allows for several other auxiliary objectives to be
investigated. First, by also testing silver nitrate at the same concentrations as the AgNPs, the
toxicity of AgNPs can be compared to that of Ag+. This allows insight into how much of AgNP
toxicity is due to ion dissolution. Second, by performing DLS on the AgNPs at relevant treatment
concentrations in media, aggregation effects may be elucidated. This is not only crucial for
properly interpreting toxicity results, but also for determining which capping agent provides more
AgNP stability in media.

Methods and Materials

A. Cell Culture
1. Cell Culturing
Cancerous HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin streptomycin. (HeLa
cells, a human cervical cancer cell line, are commonly utilized in biotechnology and
pharmaceutical research as a generic cancer cell line.) Healthy 3T3 fibroblast cells were
maintained in the same media. (Although 3T3 cells are derived from mice, they are a valid
and recommended substitution for human fibroblasts in nanotoxicology studies because of
their wide availability and their similarity to human fibroblasts.) Cultures were maintained
in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37oC. Cell lines were maintained in aerated, sterilized T25
polystyrene flasks (25 cm2 bottom) and were split biweekly with fresh media to ensure
nutrient availability, to limit population constraints, and to remove toxic metabolic
products. Sterile cell culturing protocols were followed to prevent bacterial or chemical
contamination [26]. A sample flask is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3. The HeLa cell culture forms a monolayer in a T25 polystyrene flask. The lid is slightly
ajar to allow for gas exchange between the culture and the environment.

2. Cell Splitting
Adherent mammalian cultures were split during the logarithmic phase of population growth
to prevent confluent (contact) inhibition of further growth. This was roughly every three
days, as determined by medium turbidity and a pH drop caused by lactic acid buildup
(measured using litmus paper). This procedure is required to ensure the long-term survival
of the cell culture. It replenishes media nutrients, removes dead cells and accumulated
metabolic products, and prevents the cell concentration within the flask from increasing to
levels where nutrient and physical space requirements cannot be met. Protocols are listed
in the cell culturing handbook [26].

6

3. Cell Counting
Cell lines were split into two fresh flasks before experimental use. The parent flask was
kept for the creation of the cell stock designated for AgNP treatments, whereas the two
fresh flasks were placed back into the incubator to be maintained for future experiments.
The parent flask was then subjected to a cell count using hemocytometry. A suitable
amount of DMEM was added to this flask to create a cell stock solution with a
concentration of 1x105 cells/mL.
4. Cell Incubations
100 µL of cell stock was allocated into each well of a sterile, optically transparent,
polystyrene 96-well plate. Plates were left to incubate for 24 hours. This was done to
eliminate false cytotoxicity positives caused by the biological shock of extensive pipetting.
In this way, cell cultures could stabilize before treatment testing. Before treatments were
applied, plates were inspected with a light microscope for contamination and culture
growth.
5. Cell Handling
All cell handling was performed in a Class II biosafety cabinet (Figure 4). Appropriate
safety protocols were followed (see Appendix A for details).

Figure 4. Tissue culture laboratory, Cal Poly Biology Department. The biosafety cabinet UV
light is on to sterilize the work surface before use. The light microscope was used for cell culture
inspections and hemocytometry. Separate biohazard disposal bins are present to contain either
pipette tips and flasks or biological liquids.

B. Treatment Preparation
1. In-House AgNP Synthesis
For preliminary work, AgCit and AgBPEI were synthesized in-house. This provided
inexpensive, readily available reagents for preliminary testing while experimental
protocols were being established, as well as an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of
AgNP chemistry. However, while cheaper and faster than ordering commercial AgNPs,
these in-house AgNPs were not suitable for academic research. The AgNPs used in this
study must be of the same diameter, have precise concentrations, and be contaminant-free.
Significant time investment in experimentation and financial investment in outsourced
characterization would have been required to develop a reliable, reproducible AgNP recipe
suitable for academic use at Cal Poly. Therefore, rather than try to synthesize and
characterize AgNPs in-house, it was a more prudent allocation of time and money to
purchase small quantities of fully characterized, contaminant-free commercial AgNPs.
2. Commercial AgNPs
2 mL quantities of 1 µg/mL AgBPEI and AgCit solutions were purchased from
NanoComposix (Figure 5). AgNPs arrived with manufacturer-provided characterization
information (Table I). AgBPEI is electrosterically stabilized by a coating of BPEI that
adsorbs onto the silver surface [27]. AgCit is surrounded by citrate anions that adsorb to the
silver core through polar interactions and maintain colloidal stability through electrostatic
repulsion [28]. Both types of AgNPs were purchased in 40 nm diameter size to deconvolute
size-related cytotoxicity effects from surface charge. TEM images were provided by the
manufacturer (Figure 6) to confirm AgNP size and morphology. The AgNPs were
subjected to the manufacturer’s “BioPure” screening, meaning that residual reactants were
removed, that endotoxin levels were confirmed to be below 2.5 EU/mL, and that solutions
were sterilized.

Figure 5. 1 µg/mL vials of AgCit (left) vs AgBPEI (right). Because the diameters are the same in
both types of AgNP, the slight difference in color can be attributed to visible light interference by
the capping agents.

3. AgNP Treatment Preparation
AgBPEI and AgCit stock solutions of 100 µg/mL and 25 µg/mL were prepared in sterilized
glass bottles by dilution with Millipore water. The Millipore water was micro-filtered in a
sterile vacuum hood and then autoclaved to eliminate biological contamination.
4. AgNO3
Silver nitrate stocks of 100 µg/mL and 25 µg/mL were prepared in an identical fashion to
the AgNPs. Because AgNO3 dissociates into Ag+ and NO3- in polar solutions, it is
commonly used as a reagent for Ag+ toxicity. AgNO3 was chosen as a reference against
which to compare the cytotoxicity of Ag+ versus AgNPs. Free NO3- in AgNO3 treatments
is known to have negligible effects on mammalian cells at the concentrations used in this
study [29].
5. Capping Agents
Trisodium citrate and BPEI treatments were prepared as cytotoxicity controls to
deconvolute the cytotoxic effects of the capping agents on cells.

C. alamarBlue® Viability Assay
1. Theory
Dye-based viability assays, such as alamarBlue® are an industrial and scientific standard
for preliminary cytotoxicity screening [30]. The alamarBlue® assay was performed as a
simple means of determining the extent to which mitochondrial activity was affected by
the treatment. This test uses an indicator molecule—resazurin— that is reduced by
metabolic activity to resorufin, a pink and highly fluorescent molecule. This chemical
reduction occurs inside the host cell’s mitochondrial electron transport chain, where
resazurin substitutes for O2 as a terminal electron receptor. The intensity of fluorescence
produced is proportional to the number of living cells respiring, so fluorescence
measurements can determine if the AgNP treatments hindered metabolic processes.
Because metabolic activity is a primary indicator of cell viability, this assay can be used to
measure the treated cells’ likelihood to survive and reproduce. alamarBlue® was chosen
because it is non-toxic to both organisms and the experimenter, requires relatively few
steps, and can be measured with fluorescence, which is more accurate than absorbancebased assays. While the alamarBlue® assay can provide information regarding the
proliferative capacity and overall “health” of the cells, it cannot provide direct information
distinguishing the number of necrotic cells and those undergoing apoptosis. However,
because dead or dying cells will display minimal reduction of the dye agent, and because
rendering oncogenic cells non-viable is still considered a sign of an effective treatment,
this viability assay is suitable for initial testing regarding cytotoxicity of various AgNP
treatments.
2. Day 1: Plate Preparation
The two cell culture stocks were pipetted into separate 96-well plates to avoid crosscontamination. A total volume of 115 µL was set for each well to mitigate volumetric
fluorescent quenching effects during spectrophotometry. To accomplish this, 100 µL of
cell culture stock was pipetted into treatment-designated wells, thus achieving the optimal
cell count (1x104 cells/well) for the viability assay [31] and leaving 15 µL for treatment
addition. After incubation at 37oC for 24 hours, plates were observed under a light
microscope to inspect for cell growth and potential contamination.
3. Day 2: Apply Treatments
DMEM, and the corresponding treatments, were added to achieve the designated total well
volume of 115 µL. Plate well allocation was determined by the fluorescent protocol
employed for measurement. Thus, each cell plate had its own controls and blanks, thus
minimizing experimental error between plates. The pertinent details of plate allocation are
as follows:
i. Silver Treatments. AgCit, AgBPEI, and AgNO3 treatments of 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5,
and 10 µg/mL concentrations were achieved through application of various stock
volumes to the experimental wells. This range was chosen because initial studies
with in-house nanoparticles, as well as prior work with commercial AgNPs,
suggested an LD50 within this concentration range. This concentration range was
also selected because it optimized plate well utilization for maximum data
collection.

10

ii. Capping Agents. Citrate and BPEI were tested at 10 µg/mL to allow observation
of any cytotoxicity of the polymers themselves. The highest concentration of AgNP
treatments was 10 µg/mL, but this concentration accounts only for the mass of the
AgNPs’ silver cores and not their capping agents. Because of the small volume of
capping agent needed to cover the surface of the silver core, and because the density
of silver is much higher than the polymeric capping agents, it can reasonably be
assumed that the capping agent concentration in the AgNP treatments was
considerably less than 10 µg/mL. Assuming an increase in potential toxicity with
concentration, using 10 µg/mL of pure capping agent was more than sufficient to
illustrate any potential toxicity of the capping agents.
iii. Triplicate. Each AgNP treatment was prepared in triplicate for redundancy and to
account for potential variance in cell density amongst wells delegated for the same
treatment. Mean reduction values and standard deviation per treatment were
collected from these three readings.
iv. Positive Control. Positive control wells had 100 µL of cell culture and were subject
to a 15 µL DMEM treatment to maintain consistency in well volumes. These wells
represent optimal growth conditions for cells, as no cytotoxic treatments were
applied. Their metabolic activity, as determined by the alamarBlue® dye agent,
corresponds to the fluorescence ceiling to which the fluorescence of treated cells
was compared.
v. Media Blank. Each plate was designated at least one well of pure media to blank
out fluorescent effects of media alone.
vi. Cell Blank. In preliminary research, it was confirmed that both the media and the
nanoparticles caused limited reduction of resazurin. For example, a well with
media, dye, and AgCit at 10 µg/mL induced a fluorescent output of 639.7 relative
fluorescence units (RFU). Therefore, it was decided that all treatments in the
present study were to be accompanied by one well of their corresponding “cell
blank,” wherein the same treatment was applied in the absence of cells. This
fluorescent output was subtracted from the average fluorescence of treatments
containing cells to cancel out the fluorescence noise unique to that treatment.
4. Day 3: Fluorescence Inspection
i. Fluorescence Theory. Fluorescence occurs when a molecule (here, resazurin) in
its ground state absorbs an incident photon, causing the molecule to enter an
electronically excited state. The molecule will then undergo non-vibrational
relaxation, collisional quenching, and/or heat release until it reaches the lowest
vibrational level of its respective excited electronic state. Once this non-radiative
decay is over, a photon is emitted to return the molecule back to one of the
vibrational levels within its ground state. This emitted photon must be of a longer
wavelength, or have less energy, than the incident photon because non-radiative
decay occurred prior to its emission. This is the principle behind the Stokes Shift,
or the wavelength difference between absorption and emission peaks.
ii. alamarBlue® Dye Addition. 24 hours after AgNP treatments and controls were
added, experimental plates were inspected again for contamination. This is to
circumvent the possibility of microbial contamination creating false positives for
metabolic activity. 11.5 µL of 10x alamarBlue® reagent was added to all test wells

11

on experimental plates besides those allocated for media fluorescence blanking. In
addition, alamarBlue® reagent was added to a control plate to determine the
quenching behavior of the treatments and the media. Plate lids were covered in
sterilized aluminum foil to prevent light-induced reduction, and then returned to the
incubator for another 8 hours to allow maximum resazurin reduction to take place.
This optimum incubation period was chosen because it maximizes the amount of
reduction that can take place, but isn’t so long that the positive control reduction
reaction goes to completion such that relative fluorescence comparisons are skewed
[31]
.
iii. Plate Reader. After 8 hours, the plates were simultaneously removed from the
incubator to ensure uniform incubation times with the alamarBlue® reducing agent
(Figure 7). They were then allowed 30 minutes to return to room temperature before
being inserted into a SpectraMax 360 fluorescent plate reader (Figure 8). This was
done because increased temperature can influence fluorescence emissions by either
raising the vibrational level of the fluorescent molecule, or by inducing
conformational changes in the media proteins so that they cause quenching. The
fluorescence excitation wavelength was chosen to be 555 nm, since the excitation
range is 540–570 nm. The fluorescence cutoff was set to 570 nm, which truncates
excitation radiation so it does not get picked up by the detector. Fluorescence peak
emission was measured at 585 nm, since the total emission spectrum is 580–610
nm. Fluorescence intensities were recorded in Excel.

Figure 7. 96-well plate after eight hours of incubation with the viability dye. The more pink
a well appears, the more resazurin reduction into resofurin has taken place, and thus the
more metabolically active the well is. All the treated wells were initially blue, as this is the
color of resazurin.

12

Figure 8. SpectraMax 360 plate reader with plate drawer open. Excitation and emission
wavelengths were set to 555 nm and 585 nm, respectively.

iv. Reduction Calculations. Because resazurin reduction to resofurin is caused by
cellular metabolic activity in the cell, and because metabolic activity is used to
measure cell viability, results from this assay are quantified as % cell viability. This
value represents the viability of treated cells relative to untreated cells. Specifically,
relative chemical reduction of resazurin, and thus viability, was calculated by
dividing the average fluorescence emission of the treatment wells by the average
emission of the untreated, positive control wells. This is shown in Equation 1,
% Cell Viability =

𝑭𝒂𝒗𝒈 (𝟓𝟖𝟓𝒏𝒎) 𝒐𝒇𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒄𝒆𝒍𝒍𝒔 (𝑹𝑭𝑼)
𝑭𝒂𝒗𝒈 (𝟓𝟖𝟓𝒏𝒎) 𝒐𝒇 𝒖𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒈𝒓𝒐𝒘𝒕𝒉 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒐𝒍 (𝑹𝑭𝑼)

x 100% (1)

where Favg(585nm) is the average 585 nm fluorescence emission of the treatment
series eight and half hours after dye addition, and RFU is the fluorescence unit in
which this average is measured. A cell viability value of 100% means the treatment
had no effect on its target cell population, since these cells are just as metabolically
active as the untreated control group. Conversely, a value of 0% means zero
reduction of the dye agent occurred. This means the cells are either dead or nonviable, which in either case means the treatments were effective at inhibiting the
cell line.
v. LD50 Calculation. The LD50 endpoint was calculated by linear interpolation
between the two toxicity concentrations above and below the 50% cell viability
point. LD50 calculations, even with the help of advanced software, are at best an
estimate. However, LD50 values provide suitable quantifications of toxicity trends.

13

D. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
To verify AgNP diameters and test stability in biological media, AgCit and AgBPEI samples of 5
µg/mL were subjected to temporal DLS testing (Figure 9). If the AgNPs aggregate when suspended
in media, then size-dependent toxicity mechanisms can obfuscate the effects of surface charge.
Therefore, AgNPs must maintain similar diameters in vitro for valid toxicity comparisons based
on surface charge.

Figure 9. The Wyatt Technologies DynaPro NanoStar in the Cal Poly Chemistry Department was
used for DLS testing.

1. DLS Theory
DLS provides the size and number distribution of particles in a solution by applying laser
light scattering principles. For example, smaller particles exhibit enhanced Brownian
motion over larger particles, so this increases Doppler shift effects in the light they scatter.
A photon counter correlates these fluctuations in light scatter to their diffusion constant,
which is used to calculate their hydrodynamic diameter (HDD) through the Stokes-Einstein
equation.
2. Sample Preparation
Concentrations of 5 µg/mL were prepared for AgCit and AgBPEI in glass cuvettes
containing either Milli-Q water or media. Because toxicity results indicated LD50s below
5 µg/mL, and because aggregation effects usually increase with concentration, 5 µg/mL
was chosen as the concentration above which aggregation behavior would be irrelevant
because potential treatments would be confined to lower concentration ranges. The total
volume of each cuvette was held to 0.8 mL. AgNP solutions in Milli-Q water were prepared
to obtain baseline HDDs, whereas those in DMEM were prepared to test for aggregation.
The DMEM solution contained the same FBS, penicillin streptomycin, amino acid, and

14

vitamin concentrations as the cell culturing media. In this way, the AgNP aliquots in media
reflect the in vitro conditions experienced by the AgNPs during toxicity testing.
3. pH Measurement
Before testing, the DMEM solution was measured using a pH probe and found to have a
pH of 7.27. This correlates well to the pH range of human blood, which is between 7.35 to
7.45. In this way, there is an accurate model of physiological pH.
4. Aggregation Kinetics
Measurements were taken every five minutes for 45 minutes after the samples were
prepared. This was done to allow sufficient time for nanoparticle aggregation to occur, as
well as to detect any time-dependent stabilization behavior. Time t=0 min. represents a
DLS reading immediately following the dispersal of AgNPs into the medium of interest (a
process that took less than 1 minute).
5. Parameters
A reference sample consisting of polystyrene nanoparticles of known diameter was run to
ensure DLS accuracy. When the DLS passed this control, the AgNPs were then tested. 10
individual tests were run per time period, per AgNP. Each test consisted of 5
measurements. Therefore, the HDDs presented are the average of 10 averages.

Results and Discussion
A. Viability Assay
1. Trend of Superior AgBPEI Cytotoxicity
Dose-dependent curves for HeLa and fibroblast cells are shown in Figures 10 and 11,
respectively. Both figures illustrate a general trend in which AgBPEI is more cytotoxic
than AgCit. This trend holds for both cell lines, as AgBPEI effectively induces total cell
death at concentrations less than 5 µg/mL. This supports the initial hypothesis that AgBPEI
would display enhanced cytotoxicity because AgBPEI’s positive surface charge facilitates
increased Coulombic interactions with the negatively-charged cell surface. On the
contrary, AgCit’s negative surface charge discourages interaction with cells, thus
attenuating cytotoxic response.

Figure 10. Dose-response curve for AgNP treatments on the cancerous cell line. AgBPEI displays
superior toxicity to AgCit for all concentrations except 7.5 and 10 µg/mL where toxicity
differences become statistically insignificant. The increase in cell viability as these latter
concentrations is likely caused by AgNP aggregation.

Figure 11. Dose-response curve for AgNP treatments on the fibroblast cell line. The 2.5 µg/mL
treatment suggests that disparities in AgNP toxicity are evident mostly between 1 and 5 µg/mL.
Outside of this concentration range, differences in AgNP toxicity are minimal.

16

It should be noted that while the differential AgNP toxicity trend ostensibly reverses in the
HeLa line at 7.5 and 10 µg/mL concentrations, this difference is not statistically significant
(t-test, p < 0.05) and can be attributed to AgNP aggregation and polydispersity.
2. HeLa Trends
i. Toxicity Decrease after 5 µg/mL. The general decrease in AgNP toxicity in the
HeLa line above 5 µg/mL is likely due to concentration-enhanced aggregation
effects. Aggregation diminishes AgNP cytotoxicity through several mechanisms
[13]
. First, because many AgNPs coalesce, there are less net particles in the treatment
to cause toxic effects: there are less “bullets” to kill the cells. Second, because there
are fewer small AgNPs and more large AgNPs, there is a net reduction in surface
area available for Ag+ dissolution. Because ion dissolution is the predominant
toxicity mechanism of AgNPs, this decreases AgNP toxicity. Third, larger, bulkier
AgNPs have worse chances of permeating through the cell membrane or being
endocytosed by the cell, thus decreasing the likelihood of AgNP interaction with
the cell. Aggregation would also increase AgNP polydispersity, which exacerbates
size-dependent toxicity effects and allows for increased deviation in toxicity
between wells. This explains the large standard error bars on either treatment at
these concentrations.
Another potential cause is that since both capping agents can be metabolized
as food for the cells, metabolic increases to any surviving cells is possible. This
would artificially increase fluorescence and subsequently cell viability.
ii. HeLa Cell Sensitivity to Surface Charge Effects. The disparity in toxicity
between AgNPs is especially prevalent in the HeLa cell line. It is speculated that
this is because surface charge effects are more pronounced in cancer cells, since
cancer cells have a more negative surface charge than normal cells at physiological
pH [22,25] . This is mostly because cancerous cells display enhanced glycolytic
metabolism, meaning lactate anion secretion is increased significantly [32].
3. Fibroblast Trends
i. No Toxicity Decrease after 5 µg/mL. Interestingly, the fibroblast cell line did not
display the same reversal in toxicity with concentration that the HeLa line did.
AgNP aggregation probably also occurred in the 3T3 treatments because of the
similarity of in vitro environments between cell lines. Potential environmental
discrepancies could be caused by the enhanced metabolic activity and population
size of the cancer cell line, which would decrease pH [8] and increase lactate anion
secretion. Nevertheless, because the media is buffered to prevent pH fluctuations
and because the media has a high ionic strength, slight increases in H+ or anion
presence would have minimal effect. However, the cytotoxicity-diminishing effect
of AgNP aggregation would have been obfuscated in the 3T3 line because
fibroblast cells divide less rapidly than do cancer cells, so the smaller fibroblast
population was more sensitive to any toxic treatment of the same concentration.

17

ii. Differential Toxicity Window Between 1 and 5 µg/mL. Unlike HeLa cells, the
3T3 cells displayed differential AgNP toxicity mostly in the concentration range
between 1 and 5 µg/mL. The cause of this is presently unknown. Further testing of
3T3 cells with AgNP treatments within this concentration range would help
elucidate the nature of this trend.
4. Comparing Cell Line Sensitivity
i. Cancer Cells are Inherently More Viable. The HeLa cells were more robust to
AgNP treatments for two reasons: the first is difference in population size. Given
that approximately 1x104 cells were pipetted into each well, and that each well
population had an equal amount of time for stabilization and growth, it can be
assumed that the cell density per well is relatively constant per cell line. However,
this assumption does not hold when comparing different cell lines because of
differences in growth rates. Both HeLa and 3T3 lines are immortalized cell lines,
meaning that they have specific mutations that allow them to grow and divide
indefinitely under suitable in vitro conditions. However, as verified by light
microscope inspection during culturing, the HeLa cells used in this study displayed
a faster rate of division than did the 3T3 cells. (This difference is caused by various
genomic discrepancies, such as the HeLa cells’ dysregulated cell cycle and
endogenous viral genes.) Consequently, after two days of incubation, the HeLa cell
density per well was higher than the 3T3 cell density. This means there were fewer
3T3 targets than HeLa targets for the same treatment concentration; in other words,
the 3T3 line experienced a higher AgNP:cell ratio. Thus the 3T3 population was
more susceptible to AgNP treatments purely on a numbers basis.
The second reason is that cancer cells have accelerated metabolic rates. This
artificially increases viability measurements due to increased dye reduction and
subsequently increased fluorescence. This means not only are there more cancer
cells than fibroblasts per well, but each cancer cell is more metabolically active
than a fibroblast cell. Therefore, even if cell populations were identical at the time
of alamarBlue® addition, the HeLa cells would consistently reduce more resazurin
and appear more viable.
Taking these two considerations together, cancer cells are inherently harder
to kill than healthy cells because they have more effective metabolisms and higher
division rates. These effects must be taken into account when comparing the two
cell lines, especially within the context of a dye-based viability assay. Even if
individual cancer cells are mechanistically more susceptible to AgNP treatments,
as suggested by past toxicity research [8,18], it would not appear that way because of
the nature of this test.
ii. Low Concentration Trends. The toxicity explanation concerning AgNP:cell
ratios and metabolic differences suggests toxicity towards 3T3 cells should be
enhanced across all treatment concentrations. However, this is not always the case.
AgCit toxicity from 0.5-2.5 µg/mL is comparable in both cell lines. Since
low concentration treatments imparted fewer overall particles to elicit cytotoxic

18

response, the AgNP:cell ratio was low in both cell lines—regardless of differences
in population. At such low concentrations, there might be insufficient therapeutic
agents to cause detectable metabolic effects in the whole cell population. In this
way, AgNP concentration may be more of a toxicity factor than population size
because it scales multiplicatively.
Similarly contrary to expectations, AgBPEI is more toxic towards the HeLa
cells than towards 3T3 cells at these lower concentrations. Again, this is likely a
byproduct of the HeLa cells’ more negative surface charge, a factor that could
supersede the toxicity-buffering effects of increased population size and
metabolism.
B. LD50 Values
1. Superior AgBPEI Toxicity
LD50 values for the silver treatments were calculated by linear interpolation to quantify the
trends depicted in the dose-response curves (Table II). Results reveal the superior toxicity
of AgBPEI over both AgCit and Ag+ to either cell line. Compared to AgCit, AgBPEI was
approximately 84% more cytotoxic to HeLa cells and about 65% more cytotoxic to
fibroblast cells. (These values are estimates due to the approximate nature of LD50
calculations, the non-linearity of the dose-response curves, and the limited number of data
points.) However, while the veridical LD50 may be, for example, +/- 10% of the calculated
values, the trend of superior AgBPEI cytotoxicity would not disappear. In this way, these
values serve as a useful tool to compare cytotoxicity, though they should not obviate the
need for high-throughput calculations before integration into clinical applications.

2. Ag+ Toxicity
It is interesting to note that the Ag+ control treatment was less toxic than the AgBPEI to
either cell line. This contradicts the widely-held belief that the toxicity of AgNPs is due to
ion dissolution alone, and instead supports more recent work showing that physical
interactions between AgNPs the target cell also contribute to toxicity. This controversy
originated from a landmark 2012 paper by Alvarez et al. claiming that negligible
nanoparticle-specific toxicity mechanisms exist [33].

19

Any Ag+ treatment will have more free ions in solution than will a AgBPEI
treatment at any given concentration, so if ionic silver release were the sole toxicity
mechanism of AgNPs, then Ag+ should be more cytotoxic than AgBPEI, not less.
Therefore, there must be some physical toxicity factor unique to AgNPs. This agrees with
recent research indicating that toxicity mechanisms differ between ionic silver and AgNPs
[10]
. Moreover, the fact that AgBPEI is more toxic than Ag+, whereas AgCit is less toxic,
provides further evidence that surface charge-influenced physical interactions between the
AgNP and the cell membrane may be the foundation of nanoparticle-specific toxicity
mechanisms.
3. Capping Agent Toxicity
Capping agent treatments, at effective concentrations (10 µg/mL) much higher than would
be seen by a AgNP treatment of the same concentration, had either negligible cytotoxic
effects or increased the metabolic activity of the treated cells (Table III). The % cell
viability after treatment with capping agents is near or over 100%. This means that even at
the highest concentration of AgNPs, the presence of capping agent has no confounding
effect on the cytotoxicity measurements. Citrate is a known substrate for energy generation
in mammalian glycolytic and Krebs cycle pathways [34], so it makes sense that it seemed to
increase the viability of treated cells. Similarly, results suggest polyethylenimine also
stimulates metabolic activity, potentially as a base molecule for catabolic breakdown.

This means AgNP toxicity results from nanoparticle and Ag+ mechanisms, and that capping
agents alone have no considerable obfuscating effect on toxicity measurements. If
anything, because free BPEI in the growth media seems to increase cell viability moreso
than citrate, AgBPEI could be slightly more toxic than the viability assay suggests.
However, such a conclusion is unnecessary because the trend of superior toxicity of
AgBPEI is already well established and because the concentration of free floating BPEI at
AgBPEI treatments of 5µg/mL is far less than BPEI treatments at 10 µg/mL.
C. AgNP Aggregation
1. DLS Results
To isolate surface charge as the only independent variable capable of influencing
cytotoxicity comparisons, AgBPEI and AgCit were ordered at the same diameter.
However, because the AgNPs were then placed in media—a solution different than that in
which the AgNPs were synthesized and characterized—it was necessary to remeasure

20

AgNP size in media. To deconvolute the effects of potential aggregation on cytotoxicity
and model AgNP stability, HDD was measured for both types of AgNP in test media at 5
µg/mL using DLS (Table IV). While it would appear thus far that surface charge was the
only toxicity parameter that varied between AgBPEI and AgCit, DLS results suggest
otherwise.

% Intensity, or the relative amount of scattering intensity, was used to determine the true HDD
average within the size distribution chart. See Appendix B for sample size distributions and
autocorrelation curves for details on how % Intensity was used.

Once diluted to 5 µg/mL in Milli-Q water, both types of AgNPs showed slight
aggregation to the effect of a several nanometer HDD increase. However, HDDs
stabilized after 25 minutes. Since size is indirectly calculated from an experimentally
derived diffusion coefficient rather than direct measurement, and because HDD includes
the radius of the protruding capping agents, an increase of three nanometers can be
considered negligible. This supports the 40 nm diameter TEM measurements provided by
nanoComposix, which only measure the silver core.
However, both AgNPs aggregated in media. Whereas the AgBPEI HDD
stabilized at roughly 140 nm after 10 minutes, AgCit rapidly agglomerated into a wide
range of large HDDs that increased with time (Appendix B). (Here agglomerated is
defined as rapid aggregation behavior that will continue indefinitely until the nanoparticle
falls out of suspension.) This means that AgCit is not stable in the test media, and that the
AgNP treatment HDDs in the viability assay were not constant. Thus, cytotoxicity
differences between the types of AgNPs cannot be attributed solely to surface charge, and
size-dependent toxicity effects must be taken into account when interpreting the toxicity
results.
2. AgBPEI more Bioavailable than AgCit
As previously mentioned, an increase in AgNP diameter corresponds to reduced particle
count, reduced surface area for ion dissolution, and hindered ability to enter the cell: all of
which result in decreased cytotoxic effects [13]. It should be noted that because of the
limitations of HDD measurements, it is not known whether individual AgNPs aggregated
into a multi-particle cluster or physically coalesced into a single, large particle. The
21

cytotoxic differences between the two are also unknown, although in either case toxicity
would still decrease. Therefore, if AgNP aggregation occurs, its mechanisms of interaction
with the target cells are attenuated. This is especially the case if the AgNP becomes so
large that it falls out of suspension and is not available to physically interact with the target
cells. So not only was there a repulsive Coulombic force between the AgCit and the target
cells’ membrane, but AgCit’s agglomeration in vitro further reduced its likelihood of
interacting with the cells. In this way, AgBPEI is more “bioavailable” than AgCit because
AgBPEI is more available in the biological environment to interact with cells. Although
surface charge effects are not solely responsible, this increased bioavailability directly
correlates to increased cytotoxicity. Therefore, AgBPEI’s enhanced bioavailability makes
it a superior nanoparticle over AgCit for targeted tumor therapies and other such inherent
toxicity applications.
3. Aggregation Mechanisms
The stability of colloidal nanosilver is contingent on surface interactions with its solution.
Specifically, the physico-chemical properties of the AgNP capping agents determines how
salts, proteins, and other biomolecules in media will interact with the AgNPs. Similarly,
solution properties such as pH, solvent polarity, and solute composition and concentration
influence AgNP aggregation [35].
i. Capping Agents. Both capping agents are physisorbed onto the silver core through
secondary bond interactions.
BPEI, a heavily branched dendrimer, stabilizes AgBPEI by providing a treelike network of polymer chains that mechanically obstructs AgBPEI from
coalescing. This steric hindrance can utilize osmotic pressure gradients and coil
compression mechanisms to discourage AgBPEI aggregation [36]. Additionally,
BPEI also offers electrostatic repulsion by virtue of the net positive charge imparted
by its amine groups, which are protonated in solution. This means the AgBPEI
Coulombically repels other positively-charged AgBPEI.
On the other hand, citrate capping agents are limited to electrostatic
repulsion. Citrate is a derivate of citric acid, and is a polyatomic anion (C6H5O73− )
in solution. Its negative charge repels other negatively charged AgCit. Because the
silver nanoparticle core also has a slight negative charge, citrate binds more weakly
to the silver nanoparticle than BPEI [27].
Since BPEI provides electrosteric repulsion, as opposed to simply
electrostatic repulsion, it is generally considered a more stable capping agent than
citrate [35].
ii. AgBPEI. In the case of AgBPEI aggregation, two explanations are possible: either
counterions and proteins from the media formed complexes with the nanoparticles,
or they initiated PEI bridging behavior that joined the nanoparticles through an
anion intermediate [35]. This would reflect an effective increase of AgBPEI size,
rather than AgBPEI aggregation. While the ionic strength of the media may have
diminished electrostatic stability mechanisms, steric hindrance would have
remained unaffected. Since AgBPEI retained at least one mechanism of
maintaining colloidal stability, agglomeration did not occur.

22

iii. AgCit. Conversely, cations present in the media could have been sufficient to
initiate AgCit agglomeration. In accordance to DLVO theory [37], compression of
AgCit’s diffuse double layer would weaken electrostatic repulsion and increase the
likelihood of macroscopic van der Waals interactions (Hamaker attraction). The
weak polar association of citrate with the silver core exacerbates this trend by
providing negligible steric hindrance. Additionally, because citrate is easily
displaced, this allows for temporary exposures of the silver core to the surrounding
media. If enough surface area is exposed, then surface energy can provide sufficient
driving force to encourage nanoparticle coalescence.
It should be noted that in some cases AgCit does not show the aggregation
effects found in this study. This is due to the variability of in vitro conditions, such
as cell byproducts or test media’s pH, dilution strength, or composition.
4. Surface Charge vs. Size Effects on Toxicity
Because of the competing effects of surface charge and size on cytotoxicity, the viability
data cannot be used to support the hypothesis regarding the surface charge dependent
cytotoxicity of AgNPs. Without definitive knowledge concerning their relative impacts,
these two toxicity variables cannot be decoupled. That being said, although the initial
hypothesis cannot be explicitly supported, DLS results don’t negate its validity. Prior
research still supports surface charge dependent cytotoxicity, and AgBPEI’s significantly
enhanced toxicity is most likely at least partially due to its surface charge.

IV.

Conclusions

AgBPEI is more toxic to human cells than AgCit. AgBPEI’s superior cytotoxicity can be explained
by enhanced bioavailability to the target cells. Compared to AgCit, AgBPEI has a Coulombic
propensity, rather than an aversion, to interact with mammalian cell membranes. Moreover, AgCit
agglomerated to large sizes in test media, hindering the likelihood of cell association and
diminishing cytotoxic effects. While this prevents conclusions regarding surface charge-dependent
toxicity from being made, it reveals that AgBPEI is a more stable nanoparticle than AgCit under
in vitro conditions.
Additionally, AgBPEI was more toxic than Ag+ to both HeLa cells and 3T3 cells. Therefore,
AgBPEI toxicity mechanisms cannot be confined to Ag+ dissolution alone, because otherwise this
toxicity trend would be reversed. Although an auxiliary objective of this research, this is of interest
to the nanosilver academic community and should be considered when evaluating AgNP toxicity
mechanisms.
Lastly, because cancer cells have more negatively charged membranes than healthy cells, the
difference in toxicity between AgBPEI and AgCit was more apparent in the HeLa line than the
fibroblast line. Apparent discrepancies in susceptibility to AgNP treatments between the two cell
lines should be attributed to differences in population size and metabolic activity, and does not
necessarily reflect preferential toxicity.

Recommendations

Cancer researchers investigating AgNPs for targeted tumor applications should use AgBPEI over
AgCit on the premise of increased physiological stability and toxicity. Citrate is a commonly used
capping agent for AgNP inherent toxicity studies because of its pre-existing wealth of data and the
relative ease of AgCit synthesis. However, BPEI is a more stable capping agent that has been
shown to increase the biocidal effects of nanosilver in both microbes and eukaryotes.
VI.

Future Work

The next step in this research is to retest AgBPEI against a negatively-charged AgNP that is stable
in test media. This would isolate surface charge as the only independent variable and eliminate
aggregation effects as a source of error. For the sake of economy, AgCit will be retested in a
different, more dilute culture media before other AgNPs are explored. Once a stable, negativelycharged AgNP has been identified, the alamarBlue® viability assay will be run with high
throughput techniques to improve LD50 accuracy. Once this is complete, a complementary toxicity
assay should be pursued to corroborate the viability assay results. To this end, the Annexin V
propidium iodide stain has been chosen and its necessary lab equipment (such as a flow cytometer)
has been secured. This assay will also help differentiate apoptotic from necrotic effects, and can
provide additional information regarding the cytotoxicity mechanisms of AgNPs.
If the hypothesis regarding surface charge-dependent cytotoxicity holds, AgNP researchers should
begin comparing the cytotoxicity of various positively-charged AgNP to determine an optimal
AgNP for inherent toxicity applications. With the optimal capping agent found, the tumor targeting
phase of this research can begin. It may then also be beneficial for targeting moieties to maintain
a net positive surface charge to enhance their likelihood of cellular interaction. However, it should
not endanger cancer cell specificity, so as not to deliver AgNPs to healthy tissue. At the very least,
targeting moieties should avoid highly negative surface charges at physiological pH to enhance
the likelihood of interaction with cells of interest.
Lastly, investigations into the physical interaction with the nanoparticle and the cell membrane
will not only help facilitate targeting research, but can also provide insight into toxicity
mechanisms that differentiate AgNPs from Ag+.

A. Safety and Handling Protocols
1. Disposal & Handling of Nanoparticles
Because of their large surface-to-volume ratio, nanoparticles are very reactive. AgNPs in
particular can cause adverse environmental impacts, and exhibit a cytotoxic effect to both
microbial and animal cells [2]. Therefore, it is imperative that AgNPs are handled and
disposed of properly. Environmental, safety, and health standards of nanoparticle
handling were followed according to protocols developed by the Department of Energy
Nanoscale Science Research Centers [38].
The nanoparticles utilized in this study are contained within an aqueous solution,
so respiratory issues are not of concern [39]. Still, protective equipment such as gloves, lab
coats, and closed toed shoes were worn to prevent AgNP interactions with exposed
skin. Surfaces in the vicinity of AgNP handling (lab tabletops, benches, chairs, fume
hood, and other various lab equipment) were wiped with a damp rag to encourage
entrapment and coagulation of any lingering nanoparticles. This rag was soaked in water
and then rinsed and washed with conventional methods. This contaminated water was
then treated with dilute amounts of HNO3 and poured into the AgNP waste container. In
the event of a spill over 50 mL, a chloride containing solution would have been poured
over the spill and wiped up with the rag. Chloride ions encourage AgNP agglomeration to
microscopic sizes, which diminishes cytotoxic effects and makes cleanup easier.
When the experiment was finished, all glassware in contact with silver
nanoparticles was rinsed with deionized water, which was then poured into a designated
AgNP waste container. Once sufficient rinses were conducted, HNO3 was added to the
glassware to dissolve any remaining bulk silver and poured into the AgNP waste
container. The glassware was then washed and dried per usual laboratory procedure. The
designated waste container was flagged with an EHS (Cal Poly Environmental Health
and Safety) chemical waste disposal form, placed under a fume hood, and scheduled for
disposal.
2. AgNP Storage
AgNPs are most stable (least likely to aggregate) at reduced temperatures and minimal
lighting. AgNPs were cold shipped and upon arrival stored, sealed, and wrapped in
aluminum foil in a laboratory refrigerator (4o C). All nanoparticle handling was
conducted in sterile atmospheres to eliminate the chances of endotoxin contamination,
which might have interfered with the toxicity profile of the nanoparticle.
3. Biological Handling
Because all biological agents are eukaryotic mammalian cells, there was no immediate
biosafety hazard [26]. However, the possibility of microbial contamination necessitated
adherence to anti-microbial protocols.
Cell lines were only exposed to sterile environments to prevent contamination. To
accomplish this, cell line flasks were opened only in a vacuum hood after the hood
surface and all its contents were subject to 20 minutes of UV radiation and a 70% ethanol
29

spray. (A stronger solution would encourage protein coagulation before the alcohol could
reach and kill all the cytoplasmic constituents of the contaminating microbe, and would
thus be less effective). Disposable nitrile gloves were worn during all times and replaced
every time a new biological item was handled to mitigate chances of crosscontamination.
Cal Poly’s Institutional Review Board guidelines for the protection of human
subjects were not applicable to this research since the provided cells were not from living
sources.

B. Sample DLS Data:

Dataset 1. The size distribution (top) of AgBPEI in
media after 25 minutes reveals how % intensity (y-axis)
peak was used to determine the average HDD reported
in Table IV. This sample’s respective auto-correlation
curve (bottom) was included to illustrate data validity.

Dataset 2: The 25 minute, AgCit in water sample
showed the same small signal at 2-3 nm as in Dataset
1. This illustrates an experimental artifact of DLS
testing.

Dataset 3. AgCit agglomeration immediately following dilution in media (top left) and after 25 minutes (top right).
These size distributions are polydisperse, as indicated by multiple % intensity peaks. It is evident that the size
distribution continues to widen with time. Respective autocorrelation graphs (bottom left, bottom right) contain two
curves each, revealing the polydispersity of the samples.
