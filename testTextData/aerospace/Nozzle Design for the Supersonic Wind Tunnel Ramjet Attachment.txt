This document outlines the concept, design, and manufacturing stages of the nozzle
section to the Ramjet Attachment. This project is a subsidiary of the thesis, Baseline
Performance of Ramjet Engine”, developed by Harrison Sykes. The nozzle geometry is
based off of theoretical calculations using Isentropic and Rayleigh line flow relations for a
two-dimensional cross section. The nozzle sees an inlet temperature of 953 degrees
Fahrenheit, pressure of 28 psi, and a Mach number of 0.356 after the combustion chamber.
The nozzle section is a two foot long converging diverging nozzle to choke and accelerate the
flow to achieve an exit temperature of 597 degrees Fahrenheit, a pressure of 8.8 psi and a
Mach number of 1.5. The thrust of the system is 139 pounds. The nozzle is made out of flat
stainless steel type 304 plates jointed together to allow for variable change in the throat and
exit areas to choke the flow and optimize performance.

I. T

he following paper details the team project to build a ramjet engine per the thesis of graduate student Harrison
Sykes, “Baseline Performance of Ramjet Engine”. The ramjet project is designed to be used for senior level labs
and graduate level research. The working principle of the ramjet is to first decelerate high speed air flow to create
high pressure and low speed, then mix and combust fuel, and finally expel hot air with burnt fuel out the
converging-diverging nozzle. The ramjet engine in this work has a nominal operation point of Mach 3.3 for the inlet,
a maximum static temperature of 953 Fahrenheit, and a maximum static pressure of 31.635psi.
The ramjet engine is mounted to the exit nozzle of the Supersonic Wind Tunnel (SSWT). The duct area
dimensions of the ramjet engine are 4.937 inches wide by 4.785 inches high to match the exit nozzle of the Super
Sonic Wind Tunnel. The overall length of the ramjet engine is six feet long. The length is broken into three equal
sections of two feet for the compressor, the combustor, and the nozzle, as shown below in Fig. 1.

Figure 1. Ramjet engine diagram. The three sections of the ramjet are show, the Inlet, the Combustor, and
the Nozzle. This report will focus on the Nozzle section.
A. The Ramjet Attachment
The Ramjet project is a combined effort of four people, a thesis and three senior projects directed by the
Aerospace Engineering department at Cal Poly. Harrison Sykes is the project lead and has designed the Chassis,
procedures, manufacturing, safety, and material analysis of the system. The entire system is split into three different
parts, as seen in Fig. 1, each two feet long. The inlet design and fabrication is directed by Clinton Humphrey. The
combustion chamber and flame holder is designed by Paul Stone for a senior project. Lastly the nozzle section is the
focus of the senior project outlined by this report.
This wind tunnel is used as a hands on education tool in labs for supersonic aerodynamic principles and flow
properties at supersonic velocities. It has come under consideration to split the propulsion lab into an astronautics
and an aeronautics section thus increasing the variety of labs needed for each section. The ramjet project will be
placed in consideration to be a future lab for the aeronautics side of the department. This project is also designed to
be easily modulated to add in new sections in the future. Also, the ramjet attachment is designed to variably change
throughout the inlet, the combustion chamber and the nozzle to demonstrate and obtain optimal performance.
A ramjet is a type of jet engine that uses the forward motion of the engine to compress the incoming air precombustion, rather than using a compressor, as seen in a typical air breathing jet engine.
The inlet slows and compresses the high speed air before it passes through the combustor. Ramjet inlets utilize
shock waves to slow and compress the flow to raise internal pressure.
The combustor injects fuel into the flowing air, and then ignites it. Fuel pressure and fuel flow to the fuel injector
must be high enough such that the necessary fuel to air ratio for stoichiometry is maintained. But fuel flow should
not exceed the stoichiometric range or else the flow will be saturated with fuel to the point that the flow will not
ignite. The fuel injector ideally atomizes the fuel flow such that fuel can better mix with the air flowing through the
engine. A flame holder is used to maintain flame stability and can be as simple as a flat plate. The flame holder
shelters the flame and improves fuel mixing by inducing turbulence into the flow.
This report will discuss the design behind the nozzle and its modular capabilities.

Fuel Choice
The fuel of choice is the ever popular Jet A aircraft fuel. This is a kerosene based fuel that is used all over the
world by nearly every aircraft. However, Jet B fuel is used instead in really cold climates.
Aircraft fuel is chosen for its high energy content and combustion quality as well as its stability, lubricity,
fluidity, etc. It has a high flash point and a low freezing point making it stable and safe in many types of
environments. This fuel has a 18550 BTU/lbm (43.15 MJ/kg) specific energy.2
The stoichiometric mixing ratio, the ratio of fuel mass to air mass, found by Harrison is equal to 1/14. With the
limit from the fuel pump of 0.012 gallons per second, this results in a temperature that is far below the estimated
value based on theoretical assumptions of engine optimal performance. The engine wants to run at as high a T 4, the
temperature at the inlet to the nozzle, as possible in order to achieve the most efficient performance.
The ramjet attachment will use Jet A aircraft fuel because it is the desired fuel to use for such applications. This
fuel is also readily available within the department as it is used in many current student projects and labs.1
B. Nozzle Concepts
The area-velocity relation, shown in the analysis section, describes the effect of flow velocity from changing
area through a nozzle3. Nozzle flow will either accelerate or decelerate based on increasing or decreasing area. The
interesting aspect is that a converging section of a nozzle will accelerate flow that has a Mach number less than 1.
However, when the flow is supersonic, the Mach greater than 1, the flow will decelerate from a converging section
with the presence of shocks, the principle important in the Ramjet inlet section. A diverging section, area change
increasing, will accelerate flow when the Mach number is greater than 1. This is due to the difference in pressure of
supersonic flow where the flow wants to expand and will accelerate down the length of a diverging nozzle when
supersonic. The tricky part to accelerate flow is to design a nozzle that will have the exact area ratio between the
inlet to the nozzle and the throat related to the Mach number that will choke the flow. Choked flow is when the
Mach number at the throat is equal to 1. Choking the flow is key to a converging-diverging nozzle, if the crosssectional area ratio is not right, the flow will not be choked and thus not accelerate down the diverging section of the
nozzle.
For the Ramjet engine, there needs to be supersonic acceleration of flow out the exit of the nozzle to obtain
thrust. As discussed in the inlet section, the ramp will slow and compress the flow to subsonic velocity. The
combustion chamber burns the air and increases velocity quite a bit, as seen in the table in Appendix II. The nozzle
inlet is still subsonic, thus to achieve supersonic exit velocity the nozzle is designed as a converging-diverging
nozzle. A converging nozzle, as shown in Fig. 2, will only serve to accelerate subsonic flow to a velocity that is still
below Mach 1. A diverging nozzle, Fig. 3, will decelerate the subsonic flow.

Figure 2. Converging Nozzle. This
figure shows a converging only nozzle.

Figure 3. Diverging Nozzle.
This figure shows a diverging
only nozzle.

The design of the nozzle for the Ramjet attachment began by understanding that it had to be a convergingdiverging nozzle to obtain the proper performance and necessary supersonic exit flow velocity. Figure 4 shows
common shapes of converging-diverging nozzles.

Figure 4. Converging-Diverging Nozzles. This figure shows converging-diverging nozzles used as a basis for
the design process. The image on the right is more simplistic and reasonable for the scope of this project.
C. Objectives
The nozzle design has been narrowed down to a converging-diverging nozzle. For the scope of this project and
to increase simplicity during manufacturing the nozzle will incorporate flat panels on one side of the rectangular
cross-section. This can be seen in the right image of Fig. 4. The objective of the nozzle section is to choke and
accelerate the flow to achieve thrust. The following sections outline the design and fabrication of a nozzle that is
similar to this image.
III. Analysis
Within the analysis portion of this document the methods of calculation are presented and discussed. This analysis
portion outlines only the nozzle section using isentropic relations. The analysis portions of the other sections of the
Ramjet are discussed in their respective reports. The nozzle section begins with the outputs of the combustion
chamber.
A. Ramjet Engine Analysis for the Nozzle Section
Given the outputs from the combustion chamber, this section
uses the following equations to close and finish the model of the
Ramjet system. This section gives the final outputs of the system’s
performance parameters: thrust, exit Mach, exit temperature and
pressure. The inputs to the nozzle analysis section are: static

As mentioned above, Eq. (1), from Anderson, describes the
area-velocity relation used to explain flow through a converging-diverging nozzle.3

The area of the wind tunnel cross section is a rectangle, the product of the height and width. Using isentropic
perfect gas relations, the throat area can be found with the equation,

The nozzle throat area can be easily calculated by the cross-sectional area by Eq. (2). This throat area is the area
needed to choke the flow based on isentropic relations and perfect gas assumptions. The next calculations to show
are the isentropic relations for temperature, pressure, and density in accordance with area change. The equation,

can be used at any of the 3 locations to find the stagnation to static temperature ratio given the Mach number. The
similar equations for stagnation to static pressure and density are,

(5)

Isentropic relations do not have any stagnation losses along the length of section. As such the stagnation
temperature, pressure and density are constant throughout the nozzle. This is shown by the equations,

Combining Eqs. (3) through Eq. (8) can now calculate the static temperature, pressure, and density of the nozzle
throat using the equations,

in Eq. (13) is the velocity of the flow at the throat because the flow is choked at the throat when the
throat has an area of A*.
After finding the parameters at the nozzle throat, isentropic relations can be used again to calculate the
parameters at the end of the diverging section of the nozzle, the exit of the Ramjet. Knowing exit pressure, Eq. (10)

can be used to solve for the Mach number at the exit of the nozzle. With the throat and exit Mach, Eq. (3) and Eq.
(5) can be used to find the stagnation to static ratio at the exit of the nozzle. Then using Eq. (9) and Eq. (11),
replacing the 4’s with 5’s and the 5’s with 6’s, the exit temperature and density can be found, respectively.
Using the exit static temperature the speed of sound at the exit can be found using Eq. (12). Along with the exit
Mach number and speed of sound, the exit velocity can be calculated using the equation,
(14)
Equation (2) can then be used to calculate the ratio of the exit area to the throat area knowing the exit Mach
number. The exit area can now be found with the equation,
(15)
And now the mass flow rate at the exit can be found with the relation,
(16)
The coefficient of pressure at the exit, of ambient air, if found using the equation,

Knowing that the stagnation temperature and pressure at the exit are equal to the values at the inlet of the nozzle, the
inputs to this section, the exit velocity can also be calculated using the equation,

√

(18)

which is extremely close to the value found from Eq. (14) so the relations can be checked.
The thrust of the engine can then be calculated with the exit pressure, area, mass flow rate and velocity using the
equation,
(

)

(19)

The thrust equation shows that if the design is set to end at the atmosphere pressure then the right side of the
equation is equal to zero.

IV. Theoretical Results and Discussion
The equations expressed in the analysis section are laid out into a Matlab code and used to calculate the
theoretical results of the system. Imbedded within the code are constants that are used to counteract the theoretical
properties and add in the uncertainties and efficiency losses from the ramjet engine. For example, the combustion of
the fuel is only 50% efficient and the fuel flow capabilities are far lower then what was initially inferred.
The full table with all the parameters of the Ramjet is in Appendix II. The maximum temperature seen by the
system is at the inlet to the nozzle at 953 degrees Fahrenheit. The stagnation properties are constant along the length
of the nozzle. The stations are the same as the locations in the analysis section and Fig. 5. The nozzle accelerates the
flow to a Mach number of 1.5 and cools to an exhaust temperature of 600 degrees Fahrenheit at the exit of the
Ramjet.
In Appendix I are the plots created through Matlab that show the performance parameters at each station of the
Ramjet. These are the values that are placed into Table 1.
These are all theoretical values and have not been tested. The project ran out of time and future work will be on
comparing theoretical values to experimental values for temperature and pressure as well as Mach number to check
theoretical assumptions and calculations. One of the main reasons to test the theoretical values will be to measure

engine.

Using the Eq. (2) and Eq. (15) the throat and exit area can be calculated. These values come out to be 13.4 in 2
and 23.6 in2. Dividing by the width of the system solves for the height difference between the nozzle ramps and
the top of the test cross-section. The throat is 2.72 inches from the top and the exit is flush with the bottom at
4.785 inches.

Figure 6. Nozzle Throat and Exit Height. This figure shows a
side view displaying the displacement of the throat and the exit from
the top of the cross-section.

V. Apparatus and Procedures
The nozzle section is a 2 foot long section specifically for the nozzle portion of the Ramjet. The inlet and the
combustion chamber each have a 2 foot long section as well. Figure 1 shows a simple side view of the entire
assembly. The introduction section above discusses the basic dimensions critical to the nozzle design.
A. Apparatus
The Ramjet will be an attachment placed
upon the supersonic wind tunnel. Figure 7
shows a more detailed view of the final
assembly designed by Harrison Sykes. This
assembly will be placed right into the
supersonic wind tunnel.
The project has not gotten to the point
where the chassis is completely machined
and assembled, but Fig. 7 depicts how it
will look.
Figure 8 shows the schematic of the
supersonic wind tunnel with the location of
the valves. The Converging Diverging
Nozzle section is going to be replaced with

System. This figure shows the full schematic of the
supersonic wind tunnel including all valves and location of
the valves in the system. The safe room is not shown, but it is
located on the left side of this schematic.

B. Material Choice for Assembly
The material choice for the ramjet assembly
differs throughout the length of the assembly. In
order to stay with safety considerations for
temperatures the system may see, with
stagnation temperatures nearing 167 and 2200
Rankine, the metal must be able to meet the
temperature limits. The high speed supersonic
flow from the wind tunnel enters as a measly
167 Rankine, or -292.67 degrees Fahrenheit. Do
to the limitations of the fuel flow as presented in
Harrison’s thesis, the maximum temperature
only reaches 1413 Rankine, or 953 degrees
Fahrenheit. The area in front of the combustion
chamber will see very low temperatures due to
the high velocity air flow. The temperatures after
the combustion chamber may see very high
temperatures. The material however must meet
high temperature regulations to keep the
necessary factor of safety.1
For the Inlet, the material chosen is cold
rolled steel to meet high internal pressure
requirements. For the combustion chamber and
the nozzle the material is stainless steel type 304.
Stainless steel type 304 can withstand
temperatures up to 2500 degrees Fahrenheit
(2960 Rankine).4

C. Nozzle Design and Manufacturing
The design for the nozzle came about with
the need to keep the Ramjet analysis and the
manufacturing simple. The Ramjet engine is
designed as a two-dimensional cross section of an engine. This is due to the fact that the project is based off of a
baseline performance analyzing basic flow characteristics. With the importance of keeping the project simple, the
nozzle is designed with flat plates as the ramp instead of a curved area change as seen in most high-end nozzles,
such as the left image of Fig. 4. Also similar to Fig. 4 and shown in Fig. 9, the nozzle is changing area only on one
side of the cross-section. This keeps it simple and eliminates any possible unnecessary, unforeseeable errors.
As discussed in the material selection section, the nozzle is made entirely of stainless steel type 304. This is due
to the high temperatures and possible high pressures seen in this section. The ramps are also solid 0.5 inch stainless
steel to give a very strong and rigid support.

Figure 9. Nozzle Assembly. This figure shows an isometric view on the left and a side view of the nozzle assembly on
the right.
Figure 10 shows the variability the nozzle is capable of. Image c in Fig. 10 is the optimal geometry based on the
theoretical calculations to choke the flow. From experience it is wildly known that experimental values always have
9
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

some form of error to them, as such the calculated height needed to choke the flow may be off. As such, the
variability ensures that if the flow is not choked, then the height can be maneuvered.
The important parameters needed to
design the nozzle section are the cross
sectional area for the throat and the exit of
the nozzle. The cross sectional area is used to
derive the height different between the top of
the Ramjet test section and the throat or exit
of the nozzle. This is shown above in Fig. 6
and calculated in the theoretical results and
discussion section.
The diverging plate of the ramp is held
into place via two axes by a rod end. The rod
end is held into its vertical and horizontal
position by being tightened with a hex nut on
the top of the plate and on the bottom of the
plate.
The SolidWorks engineering drawings
are located in Appendix III along with each

greater definition.
Manufacturing was conducted in the
machine shop Mustang ’60 as well as the
Aerospace machine shop near the subsonic
wind tunnel. Three stainless steel type 304
plates were ordered from Online Metals precut to a relatively close length. This metal is
selected as it can withstand temperatures up
to 2500 degrees Fahrenheit.4 A horizontal
band saw was used to cut the slabs to length.
A simple mill as shown in Fig. 11 was

D. Procedure
The procedure of the experiment conducted has been drafted by Harrison Sykes in his thesis. The project did not
get far enough to undergo any testing and any procedure requirements for running the Ramjet attachment. The
procedure is referenced in Harrison Sykes’ thesis.
The nozzle attachment is mounted in the 3rd 2 foot section of the Ramjet. It is bolted into the section and tied
down. The ramps are held in place via a full threaded rod end that is mounted onto the second ramp, the diverging
section of the nozzle. This creates a two dimensional lock on the ramp only allowing vertical movement. The
vertical movement also changes the angles of the ramp. The main reason for having this variability in the nozzle
ramps is to ensure that the flow is choked at the throat. This allows for small changes in the throat height changing
the throat area to optimize the performance. The exit area can also change to allow for desired changes in
performance of the Ramjet.
As shown in Fig. 10 the ramps are hinged together by a ¼” rod that runs between each slab. These must be
placed into the slabs before assembling the nozzle into the Ramjet. Two ½” nuts secure the rod end in place to the
bottom plate as shown in Fig. 10 as well. This design is also capable of being modular. It can be easily swapped for
another nozzle design in the Ramjet chassis for future lab use.
The primary procedure may be referred to in Harrison Sykes’ paper. The nozzle is mounted per the operator’s
choosing and secured base plates of the Ramjet.
After sealing up the ramjet, Sykes discusses the formal procedure to running the ramjet. The first step is to
analyze the Ramjet performance without anything inside, just plain straight plates, as a dry run. This is to get a
feeling for the supersonic wind tunnel and a check to make sure it is all working as planned. Upon further
preparations, the next step is to do a dry run with the inlet, combustion chamber and nozzle all assembled inside the
Ramjet. Another dry run is conducted to make sure the flow is compressed via the inlet and the Ramjet follows the
theoretical calculations of a dry run, no fuel flow. With further preparation and safety procedures outlined by Sykes,
the Ramjet will be ready to conduct a full test. This begins with running the supersonic wind tunnel without fuel at
first to let the flow stabilize. Once the flow is stable, fuel would then be injected and ignited, and run for a short
duration. The fuel pump would then be shut off, while the wind tunnel remains running to rapidly cool and flush the
system. Refer to Sykes’ report for further detail into the procedures and safety measures.

VI. Results and Discussion
The project did not get to the point where testing and analysis was conducted. The testing will be done by Sykes
as future work. The fuel injector test was conducted and is reported in the report, “Ramjet Combustion Chamber”.
The theoretical numbers are displayed in Table 1 and in the table in Appendix I. These theoretical calculations will
be checked with experimental data in future testing of the Ramjet.

VII. Conclusion
The nozzle design is a sub-project to Harrison Sykes thesis. Through historical research, simplistic solutions and
theoretical calculations a basic two-dimensional nozzle was designed and developed for the Ramjet attachment to
the supersonic wind tunnel. The nozzle section will see a maximum temperature, at the nozzle inlet, of 953 degree
Fahrenheit and a pressure of 28 psi. The converging diverging nozzle is a modular design to allow the flow to choke
and accelerate to optimize performance and achieve thrust. The theoretical exit Mach number is 1.45 and creates a
thrust of 139 pounds.
Due to time constraints for project funding and material shipments, the project became far behind schedule.
Improvements could have been taken upon the fact that machining and fabrication should have started earlier, right
when the parts and material arrived. The lab technician was very busy with several other projects so all the
machining responsibility fell on us. As a result we quickly obtained a very good background into drilling and
tapping holes, milling, grinding and sawing material. The stainless steel is a very tough material to machine so this
served to teach us about proper spindle speeds, feed speeds, and depth of cut. Another thing we learned was how
difficult it is to machine certain cuts and that our design needs to also consider how the material will be machined.
As a result one of the major achievements from this project was to learn all about manufacturing techniques.
Another thing that was learned was that machining the parts takes a considerable amount of time. An
improvement to the project would to have allocated a lot more time for machining the parts and fabricating the
chassis. Another improvement to the project would have been to start earlier with the safety committee because it
took several weeks to get approved and then several more weeks to get approval for funding on the project.
Future work on this project will include continued work on machining all the parts, assembling the Ramjet, and
the testing phases to check theoretical calculations to experimental data. Completing fabrication is big step that
11
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics

needs to be completed as soon as possible. Experimental data will also show how the system actually reacts and as
such, efficiency numbers can be added into the theoretical data to improve the engine model.
This project taught a lot about machining different materials as well as the physical capabilities of each material.
Similar to the business world, projects such as this have many setbacks and take a lot more time than originally
planned. Overall I have learned a lot from this project, incorporating aerodynamic principles from lectures such as
shock analysis, Rayleigh line flow, and isentropic relations and adding in machining techniques and manufacturing
assemblies. The nozzle section can be taken out, manipulated and swapped for future designs as well. The future of
this project is that the Ramjet will be finished as part of the thesis and used as a future lab for the Aerospace
department lectures.

Figure 15. Nozzle Assembly. This figure shows an isometric view of the nozzle with numbers for each plate. 1 is
the generic base plate shown in Fig. 16. 2 is the first plate of the ramp shown in Fig. 17. 3 is the converging
plate of the ramp shown in Fig. 18. 4 is the diverging plate of the ramp shown in Fig. 19.

Figure 16. Generic Bottom Plate (Number 1). This figure shows a 3 view of the generic bottom plate with holes to hold
the first ramp in place and a slot where the rod end will fall into. This is a common plate used throughout the Ramjet and
did not need a drawing.

Figure 17. First Plate (Number 2). This figure shows a 3 view of the first plate that starts the ramp and connects the
converging plate.
