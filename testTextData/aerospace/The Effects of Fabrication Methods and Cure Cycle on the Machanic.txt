Abstract
This project was completed at the California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Aerospace
Engineering Structures and Composites Lab during Spring Quarter 2013. The purpose of this project was to research
and to gain insight into the effects of fabrication methods and of modifying cure cycles for Newport NB-301 12l 2x2
Twill Weave Carbon Fiber material properties. The two fabrication methods used were autoclave and heat press
(compression molding) methods. Each fabrication method used two cure cycles, a recommended cure cycle of
275°F for 1 hour and a modified cure cycle of 250°F for 1.5 hours. The exact product data sheet of the composite
used could not be found, this project attempted to generate an estimate for the missing material properties. To find
tensile properties and flexural properties for each sample, testing was completed for the different cure methods.
Material properties were found using the same standard of testing used by Newport Adhesives and Composites for
their published data. The tensile standard used by Newport was ASTM D-638 Type 1, however due to the
complexity of manufacturing the samples a simpler standard was found (ASTM D-3039). The flexure standard using
for this project and by Newport was ASTM D-790. After testing seven tensile samples and eight flexure samples for
each of the four different configurations, it was concluded that for plate fabrication the compression molding method
of the heat press resulted in the best material properties (highest modulus and highest ultimate strength. The best
mechanical properties for tensile testing resulted from the recommended 275°F cure cycle. The tensile mechanical
properties that resulted from samples cured with the heat press at 275°F had an average tensile strength of 85.5 ksi
(590 Mpa) and an average tensile modulus of 7.08 Msi (48.8 GPa).Unfortunately the flexure testing was not
effective in displaying a clear trend for the best cure cycle. Thus no conclusion could be drawn to determine the best
curing cycle for flexure.

Introduction

A composite material is a combination of two or more distinct materials to have a recognizable interface
between them. Composites are used not only for their structural properties, but also for electrical, thermal, and
environmental properties. Modern composites are typically optimized to achieve a balance of properties for specific
applications. Given the vast range of materials that may be considered as composites and the broad range of uses for
which composite materials may be designed, it is difficult to agree upon a single, simple, and useable definition. A
common practical definition: composite materials may be restricted to emphasize those materials that contain a
continuous matrix that binds together an array of stronger reinforcing material. The resulting composite material has
a balance of structural properties that is superior to either material alone.
1.1

Fabrication Methods
There are four main fabrication methods that industry uses to manufacture their composite parts: open
molding of composites (wet lay-up and spray-up), open molding of advanced composites (pre-preg lay-up),
compression molding, and resin infusion method. (Strong)[1] This project examines pre-preg lay-ups and
compression molding for determination of optimum properties.
With open molding of composites, the resin is added while the fibers are being placed into the mold, thus
this process is called “wet.” There are two methods of placing the fibers into the mold: the lay-up and the spray-up
methods. With the lay-up method fibers are in the form of fabrics or mats and resin is applied by hand to the mat
which has already been situated within the mold (Figure 1). With the spray up method the fibers are chopped and
sprayed into the mold simultaneously with the resin (Figure 2). Depending of the surface finish desired for the part,
a gel coat layer can be added which acts as a protective and decorative surface for the part. Because these processes
are labor intensive and messy this method tends to be used for prototypes or components with a short production
series.

Figure 1 - Lay-up molding. [1]

Figure 2 - Spray-up molding. [1]

A more advanced method similar to the wet layup method is the resin infusion method or resin transfer
molding (RTM). In this method dry fibers are placed into a mold and the mold is closed. The resin is then injected
into the mold, so that the fiber is fully saturated with resin. The resin is cured and the mold is opened, and the part is
extracted. The basic resin infusion process is illustrated in Figure 3. The advantage of this method over the “wet”
methods previously described is that this method tends to produce higher quality parts more repeatedly. RTM also
eliminates the high labor requirements and can often be automated.

Figure 3 - Basic resin infusion process. [1]
With open molding of advanced composites the material used is no longer raw carbon fiber cloth or mat but
pre-impregnated cloth (pre-preg). Pre-preg is a sheet of woven fiber which is pre-coated in matrix resin that meets
the ratio desired in the final part. The matrix resin is typically partially cured epoxy. The resin is partially cured so it
is easier to handle and does not run off the fibers. Parts are made by laying sheets of pre-preg into a mold. Layers of
pre-preg are placed into the mold until the desired thickness is achieved. Curing is usually done under vacuum and
then pressure which reduce the number of voids and allows the fiber content to be maximized. If the assembly has a
large number of plies, air is evacuated between the layers (usually 4 plies at a time) using a vacuum in a process
called debulking. This process may be done several times as layers are added to ensure that the majority of interlamina air voids are removed. When the lay-up is complete the next step is to cure the part. Two tasks must be
accomplished during cure: the first is curing and that is done by heating the part; the other is to reduce void content
often achieved by debulking. The parts can be cured in an autoclave or clamshell mold. Autoclaves are pressure
vessels that allow the simultaneous imposition of pressure by vacuum and heat. Figure 4 shows how parts are
vacuum bagged when in an autoclave.

Figure 4 - Vacuum bag system. [1]

The last method, compression molding, uses a specific amount of material (uncured resin and fibers) placed
into the cavity of a matched mold in the open position as seen in Figure 5. The mold is closed by bringing the male
and female halves together, and pressure is applied to squeeze the composite material so it uniformly fills the mold
cavity. While under pressure the material is heated so that it cures. The molding process can require high pressures,
and so the molds are mounted in large presses. The presses allow rapid mold cycles and high-volume production
therefore, this process is widely used in the automotive industry and in other industries where high volumes of
small-to-moderate-sized parts are manufactured. The squeezing of the material results in low void contents in the
finished parts.

molding process.

Applications
The use of composites is in high demand due to their enhanced mechanical characteristic and material
properties. Traditional composite markets include the automotive industry which has used fiberglass reinforced
composites for several decades. [1] Weight savings has always been an advantage that composite manufacturers use
to sell their product. However, in recent years steel companies have been able to come up with new alloys that allow
for thinner lighter parts; so large portions of automobile bodes are still made of steel. Composites also present
properties that make for good “no-dent” body panels for things like hoods and trunks. Aside from the automotive
industry, the marine industry uses glass fiber reinforced polymer materials in “approximately 70% of all outboard
pleasure boats 15 ft. and longer.” [1] A major benefit of using composites the ability to use molds, this allows for
seamless construction of high strength and high durability boats. Composites also present minimal maintenance and
resistance to corrosion, rust, dry rot, and water logging experienced by other materials like wood or metal.
Composites have been used in sporting equipment like: golf clubs, tennis and racquetball racquets, pole-vaulting
poles, archery bows and arrows, snow skis and snow boards, water skis and surfboards, bicycles, bats, and many
other light weight high strength applications.

The military and aerospace industry has used composites for several years for non-critical components like
access floors and engine cowlings; however the use of composites in aircraft propellers has allowed newer turboprop
aircraft to become more efficient and lighter. Most recently, Boeing has increased the utilization of composites in
the design of the Boeing 787. The 787 is the first commercial aircraft currently certified that is constructed almost
entirely of composites. Airbus has also been designing a majority composite aircraft with the Airbus A350 do to be
introduced in mid-2014.

Objective of Work
The goal of this project originally was to examine and compare torsional performance of a carbon fiber
wing versus that of an aluminum wing. The project also included delamination testing of carbon-Nomex© sandwich
ribs. Problems were encountered when the exact product data sheet of the composite used (Newport NB-301 12k
2x2 Twill weave Carbon Fiber) could not be found. It was determined that the scope of project had grown too much
to be completed in the time frame available. Therefore, the project goal became to research and to gain insight into
the effects of fabrication methods and the effects of modifying cure cycles, on the composite’s material properties.
This project attempted to generate an estimate for the missing material properties. This was started by testing
composite samples for tensile properties and flexure properties. The product data sheet obtained for the NB-301
matrix resin had properties for Unidirectional Carbon Fiber Tape as well as 3k Plain weave carbon pre-preg
however, the material being used was 12k 2x2 Twill Weave pre-preg. Therefore this project attempted to find the
material properties using the same standard of testing used by Newport Adhesives and Composites for their
published data. The tensile standard used by Newport was ASTM D-638 Type 1, however due to the complexity of
manufacturing the samples a simpler standard was found and used (ASTM D-3039). The flexure standard used for
both this project and by Newport was ASTM D-790.

Fabrication

2.1 Carbon Fiber Sample Fabrication
This project looked to compare two methods of pre-preg
carbon fiber fabrication; autoclave fabrication and composite press
fabrication. The autoclave fabrication process used heat and vacuum bag
pressure as well as the autoclave vessel pressure during all segments of
the cure cycle. Composite press fabrication utilized force and heat
during all segments of the cure cycle. Tensile test samples and 3-point
bend test samples were fabricated using both methods and two different
cure cycles resulting in four sets of samples for each test.
Both methods used Newport 301 matrix with 12k 2x2 Twill
weave carbon fiber, which can be seen in Figure 6. Newport 301 matrix
is a 250°F to 300°F cure controlled flow epoxy resin system.[2] The prepreg has a recommended cure cycle, which is seen in Figure 7, calling

properties. With the samples fabricated using the autoclave the cure
cycles used were those seen in Figure 7 and Figure 8. The for the tensile test samples fabricated in the autoclave the
pre-preg was cut into 3 8” x 11.5” rectangles (as seen in Figure 9) and inserted between two layers of nonporous
Teflon© coated release cloth and breather bleeder cloth. The non-porous Teflon© coated release cloth was cut to
have a minimum of an one inch border around the part so that it would not stick to the aluminum tool plate, the
vacuum bag or the breather bleeder. The breather bleeder is a porous cotton cloth used to allow the vacuum to suck
out all the air from the bag and create an even vacuum pressure over the entire part. When placed in the autoclave
the part was inserted with 30 inHg of vacuum (approx. 15 psi), then the part was submitted to an autoclave pressure

of 50 psi. This same method was completed for the 3-point bend test samples except the pre-preg was cut to 8 6” x
9.5” rectangles.

The second fabrication method used the Tetrahedron Heating Press seen in Figure 10. Using the press
the maximum force which could be applied to the part is 1000 lbf, for the tensile test plates which were 8” x 11.5”
the resulting pressure was around 11 psi, and for the 3-point bend test plates which were 6” x 9.5” a pressure of
around 17.5 psi. With the composite press there was only heat and force, therefore the breather bleeder was left out
for these cures. The carbon plates were then put in between two layers of nonporous Teflon© coated release cloth
and vacuum bag material. As before the Teflon© release cloth was cut to have a one inch border around the carbon
fiber plates so that is would not stick to the vacuum bag material. The vacuum bag material was used as an extra
layer of release film preventing the part from sticking to the press plates; which were 12” x 12” and for this reason
the vacuum bag film was cut to 14” x 14” squares.

Once the fabrication of the sample plates was completed it was noted that the 3-point bend test samples
fabricated in the heat press were thinner expelling more resin than the parts fabricated using the autoclave. The
average plate thicknesses can be seen in Table 1. From these numbers, it seems that the heat press results in a 15%
thinner plate when compared to the autoclave.

Testing and Results

3.1 Tensile Properties Testing Method (ASTM D3039)
Testing of the four different tensile test samples was performed according to ASTM standard D3039. [3] In
this standard, the specimens were to be 10” x 1”. The specimens were cut using a tile saw and a part guide set to the
desired dimensions, parallel to the blade, for repeatability between cuts. Once the specimens were cut, all
dimensions and abnormalities were recorded and the specimens were numbered to ensure accurate inputs for testing.
The standard recommends using either aluminum tabs or emery cloth tabs for compatibility with the grips. In this
project 1.5” emery cloth was used, meaning that the sample test span was reduced to 7 inches. The resulting
specimens looked like what can be seen in Figure 11.

Figure 11 - Carbon Fiber Tensile Test Sample.

The standard tension testing method was programed in the Instron machine using Bluehill 2 software,
allowing for all specimens to be tested in the same manner. Each specimen was placed into the Intron clamps so that
they were parallel to the axis along which the tensile force was applied to ensure the samples were submitted to
purely tensile loads. The carbon fiber specimens were then tested at the 0.05 in/min extension rate given by the
standard, until they either failed or the load dropped by 40 percent. The software recorded the load and the extension
and calculated strain and stress for each sample. The recorded data was then analyzed using the equations for
Tensile Stress/Tensile Strength (Equation 1 and Equation 2), Tensile Strain/ Ultimate Tensile Strain (Equation 3),
and the Tensile Modulus of Elasticity(Equation 4) given within the ASTM standard.[3]

Results of Tensile Testing
With the tensile tests completed the load and the extension data gathered from each set of tests was
processed using Equations 1-3. Each set of tests consisted of seven samples of three layers of the NB-301 12k prepreg and the resulting calculated stress and strain values were plotted per test set and are seen in Figure 12 - Figure

The slopes of the stress-strain curves in the linear region between 0.001 and 0.003 strain (as dictated by the
standard) was used to calculate the elastic modulus. The slopes of each sample for the separate cases are consistent
each other, this depicts how accurate each testing procedure was followed. Table 2 shows the average modulus
gathered from each of the tests. Looking at Table 2 it can be noted that the percent relative standard deviation for the
average tensile modulus ranged from 1.33 to 3.44% which means the tests gave consistant results. From these values
it can be seen that the Heat Press at 275°F results in the highest tensile modulus at 7,080,000 psi (40.8 GPa).

ranged from 2.91 to 6.83%, further supporting that the tests gave consistant results. Table 2 shows that the highest
tensile strength comes from the samples fabricated in the heat press at 275°F for 1 hour. Looking at the maximum
load achieved by the samples, of all the fabrication methods, it was found that the maximum load for all four
samples was around 6500 lbf (29000 N). Therefore, looking at results from the tensile testing it looks like the
optimum fabrication method was the heat press compared to autoclave because it produced higher results for both
samples regardless of cure cycle. When looking at the cure cycle it can be seen that the recommended cycle was
best, over the modified cure cycle. The press samples demonstrated a difference from the 275°F cure modulus to the
250°F cure modulus of 800,000 psi (5.5 GPa) The autoclave samples showed a difference of 80,000 psi (0.6 GPa) in
modulus This lead to the conclusion that in tension the recommended 275°F produces the strongest parts.
Another observation
made during testing was the
failure mode of the tensile test
samples. All the samples failed
laterally at two points around
an inch from the tabs/grips
(Figure 16). It was also noted
that all the samples started
having fiber failure around
1,000 to 2,000 lbs before the
sample ultimately failed. At
failure the fracture had high
internal energy illustrated by
failure resulting in pieces of
carbon fiber flying out of the
machine.

Flexure Properties Testing Method (ASTM D790)
Testing of the four different 3-Point Bend test samples were performed according to ASTM standard
[4]
D790. This standard had multiple sub-standards for what size the test specimen should be. For this set of tests the

16

Adriano Agostino
“High-Strength Reinforced Composites, Including Highly Orthotropic Laminates” section was used. This section
states the span-to-depth ratio should be chosen to cause failure in the outer fibers of the specimen due to a pure
bending moment. A minimum span-to-depth ratio of 16:1 must be used. The resulting target sample size is depicted
by Figure 17. The specimens were again cut using a tile saw and a part guide that was set to the desired dimensions
parallel to the blade for repeatability between cuts. Once the specimens were cut all dimensions and abnormalities
were recorded and the specimens were numbered to ensure accurate inputs for testing. The standard states that “The
specimen shall be long enough to allow for overhanging on each end of at least 10% of the support span.” For this
reason it was calculated that the support span should be 4.000 inches.

Figure 18 - Carbon Fiber 3-Point Bend Test Sample.
The standard 3-point bend testing method was then
programed in the Instron machine using Bluehill 2 software,
allowing for all specimens to be tested in the same manner.
Each specimen was placed onto the supports as seen
depicted in Figure 18.
The carbon fiber specimens were then tested at the
0.05 in/min crosshead rate given in the standard until they
either failed or the load dropped by 40 percent. The software
recorded the load and the extension and calculated strain and
stress for each sample. The recorded data was then analyzed
using the equations for Flexure Stress/Flexure Strength
(Equation 5), Flexure Strain/ Ultimate Flexure Strain
(Equation 6) and the Tangent Modulus of Elasticity
(Equation 7) given within the ASTM standard.[4]

Results of 3-Point Bend Testing
With the 3-point bend tests completed the load and the deflection data gathered from each set of tests was
processed using Equations 5-7. Each set of tests consisted of eight samples of 8 layers of the NB-301 12k pre-preg
and the resulting calculated stress and strain values were plotted per test set seen in Figure 19 - Figure 22.

Figure 22- Flexure Stress-Strain Curve from Heat Press Fabrication at 275°F.
The slopes of the stress-strain curves in the linear region (as dictated by the standard) were used to
calculate the elastic modulus. Unlike the tensile samples, the slope of each sample for the separate cases tended to be
more distributed. This distribution is due to some samples taking longer to seat than others. Table 3 shows the
average modulus gathered from each of the tests. What can be seen is that regardless of how long the samples took
to seat the average modulus is fairly consistent, resulting in a relative standard deviation ranging from 2.71 to
8.16%. From these values it can be seen that the Heat Press at 250°F resulted in the highest tensile modulus of
7,550,000 psi (52.1 GPa).

The same factors which were considered with the tensile testing were again used with the 3-point bend
testing. A valid comparison between the autoclave and the heat press could not be done using this data as can be
seen in Table 1. There is a drastic difference in the thickness of the autoclave samples and the heat press samples.

20

Adriano Agostino
Looking at Equation 5 and 6 it can be found that both stress and strain are thickness (depth) dependent, therefore
comparing the two manufacturing processes using the results of the 3-point bend tests would be inaccurate.
However, there is still a valid comparison between cure cycles. Looking at the heat press samples, the flexure
modulus improved with the 250°F cure cycle; however, there is no improvement in flexure strength and maximum
load. This trend was also seen with the autoclave cured samples. This leads to the conclusion that lowering the cure
temperature to 250°F and increasing cure time to 1.5 hours does not provide any material property benefits.
Another observation made during testing was the failure mode of the bend test samples. All of the samples
failed at the point where the load was being applied, resulting in small inter-lamina fractures or delamination. These
failures were often not visible once the sample was not loaded.
3.5

Determining the Volumetric Ratios of Samples
One of the most important factors determining the properties
of composites is the relative proportions of resin and matrix. The
relative proportions can be given as the weight fraction or the volume
fraction. In theoretical composites the optimum volumetric ratio is
40% Resin and 60% Fiber. In order to determine the volumetric ratios
for the samples the weight fractions need to be determined. This is
done by weighing and measuring the volume of the samples, and then
placing the samples in a furnace between 1000°F to 1400°F to remove
all the resin from the sample. This process can be seen in Figure 23.
The sample was then weighed again once all the resin was removed;
this took 45 minutes to an hour. The final weight was the weight of the
fiber and the difference from the original weight was the weight of the
resin. With all the weights recorded, equations from Bhagwan
Agarwal’s text Analysis and Performance of Fiber Composites [5]
(seen as Equations 8 and 9) were used to find the matrix and fiber
volume fractions.

Where Vf is the volume fraction of fiber, ρc is the density of the composite, ρf is the density of the fiber, Vm is the
volume fraction of matrix, and ρm is the density of the matrix.
The NB-301 data sheet [2] supplies the specific gravity of the NB-301 resin to be 1.22± 0.02; using the
density of water, the density of the resin (ρm) is calculated to be 0.044 lbm/in3 (1.22 g/cm3). From the data sheet it
was also found that the carbon fiber used was 34-700 carbon fiber. Using data supplied from Grafil Inc.’s website it
was determined that the density of 12k 34-700 carbon fiber is 0.065 lbm/in3 (1.80 g/cm3) .[6] Finally, using the
recorded values of weight and volume of the samples the density of the composite was calculated. Using Equation 9,
the volume fraction of the matrix and the volume fraction of the fiber were calculated. The results of these
calculations can be seen in Table 4.

Unfortunately, the data from the Autoclave samples vary. It would appear that for both the tensile samples
fabricated in the Autoclave the volumetric ratios is 50% fiber 50% matrix which would mean that the composite is
oversaturated with resin. With the thicker 3-point bend samples the trends are about the same, maybe even more
oversaturated, as can be seen with the sample cure at 275°F which has a 62% matrix ratio and a 38% fiber ratio.
Because all these samples were over-saturated the pressure in the autoclave was not enough to eliminate the excess
resin. Looking at the heat press cycles the ratios for both the samples cured at 250°F was around 50% Fiber and 50%
Resin. It was only when looking at the samples cured at 275°F in the press that the results demonstrated a higher
ratio of fibers than matrix, with 53% Fiber to 47% Matrix. This is still however theoretically over-saturated.
Looking at the tensile samples section of Table 4, it can be noted that the fiber volume ratios for the
autoclave samples and the 250°F heat press samples are very similar and this seems to match up with the trend seen
with the tensile moduli. The tensile test samples cured at 275°F in the heat press have a higher fiber volume ratio
which possibly explains why the tensile modulus of this set was higher than the previous three sets. The results of
the volumetric ratio calculation with the 3-point bend test samples didn’t seem to match any trends seen in testing.

Conclusion

4.1

Overview of Research and Results
ASTM standards D-3039 and D-790 were used to generate mechanical properties for the composites at
different cure cycles while using different fabrication methods. From this mechanical data the tensile properties
showed that using the heat press produced higher elastic moduli for both curing cases. The highest tensile strength
occurred with the recommended cure cycle of 275°F for an hour. Looking at the effects of cure cycle on mechanical
properties, the recommended cure cycle produced a higher tensile modulus for both fabrication processes. There was
no clear trend demonstrated for a particular curing cycle when comparing tensile strength. From the mechanical data
the flexure properties showed that for both fabrication methods the flexure modulus was improved with the 250°F

22

cure cycle. There is no improvement in flexure strength and maximum load. This data leads to the conclusion that
lowering the cure temperature to 250°F and increasing cure time to 1.5 hours does not provide any material property
benefits.
Because there were no clear trends for which fabrication method was better, and because the standard’s
specimen rules were not completely met, the flexure tests should be repeated for more accurate and conclusive
results. The key conclusion drawn from the testing results on both the tensile and flexure properties is best fabricated
using the recommended cure cycle of 275°F for one hour. Another conclusion that could be drawn is that heat press
fabrication results in stronger plates.
4.2

Future Work Recommendations
If the research were to be continued, the tests should be repeated using the ASTM D-638 Type 1 standard
for the tensile testing. This would replicate what Newport Adhesives and Composites used to produce their product
data sheet. As previously mentioned, the flexure testing should be repeated and the standard should be followed
more strictly to ensure that the test results could be compared more accurately. It would also be informative to
complete compression testing using the ASTM D-695 standard, and short beam shear testing using the ASTM D2344 standard. If these tests were properly completed then the project could continue toward its original goal of
comparing the torsional performance of a carbon fiber composite wing to that of an aluminum wing.
If the testing is properly completed the results of the project could be applied to other projects such as those
completed by the SAMPE chapter at Cal Poly for the beam competition each year. Carbon fiber beams built this
year by the teams had been having issues of delamination. If the findings of the short beam shear tests show that the
interlaminar strength of NB 301 12k 2x2 Twill weave carbon is greater than that of the current LTM45 pre-preg
matrix with CF1803 bidirectional woven carbon fiber, then the data presents a reason to consider improving current
beam construction.
