Introduction
Since its opening in 2010, the Cal Poly’s Simpson Strong-Tie Material Demonstration Laboratory has
been used for multiple activities by the College of Architecture and Environmental Design. Currently, the
bottom floor is used for Construction Management laboratory classes. These classes allow students to
practice construction techniques at full scale. The size of these projects is problematic when assemblies
need to be moved or when the finished structure needs to be removed from the building. For example,
one class builds a small portion of a traditionally constructed house. The roof for this structure is
constructed on the ground and lifted into place atop walls. Currently, the lifting is accomplished with the
student’s brute force and a forklift, which is ineffective, dangerous, and requires advance coordination
with the Facilities Department. Installing a crane overhead would allow projects to be maneuvered
safely.
Scope of the Report
This report investigates the existing building’s structural ability to accommodate an overhead crane.
There are several ways to add an overhead crane to a building. This report investigates attaching a crane
to the roof beams. For an explanation of the decision, see the Estimate of Existing Capacity section. The
ability to support a crane is dependent on the available capacity of the existing structure. Specifically,
this report considers the capacity of the existing roof and columns for the new crane loading. The
concrete walls and foundations were not evaluated because of impending and unknown loading from
cantilever load racks. The analysis is also limited to the gravity system. The crane represents about a 7%
increase in the weight of the roof. Therefore, it is likely the lateral system has the capacity for the
increased forces. The report only considers the structural impact of a crane and does not consider
electrical or MEP systems.
This report also covers working in an interdisciplinary design team and managing a project. Working
collaboratively requires professional communication and time management. The techniques used
helped ensure timely completion of the project despite the lack of structured class time.
Report Overview
The final deliverable for this senior project was a set of calculations that will be used in the proposal
process to Cal Poly Facilities. The report opens with a discussion of project management techniques for
small projects and how they were applied to create the calculation package. Then the report outlines an
analysis procedure for building additions illustrated by examples from this project. The procedure begins
with the verification of existing conditions, followed by estimating the existing capacity to decide which
design to pursue. Once the general direction is decided the new loading needs to be defined. Then, if all
the previous steps indicate the addition is possible, the report describes how complete the final design.

Project Management
A successful project depends not only on the individual skills of the team members, but also on their
ability to work together towards a common goal. A well-managed project facilitates collaboration
through communication of clear objectives. The management process for small projects can be outlined
through the following steps:
Management Process for Small Projects
Initial Tasks
 Choosing Design Team
 Kick-Off Meeting
o Project Defined
o Project Deliverables and Due Dates
o Establish Methods of Communication
 Determine Project Priorities
During Project
 Communication Between Team Members: RFI Process
 Scheduling
o Schedule
o Weekly Status Reports
Brief Descriptions of the Steps:
Design Team
Traditionally, a design team consists of an owner, contractor, architect, and engineer. Each member
contributes their specific expertise to the project. The design team for the Simpson Strong-Tie building
project consisted of Amy Poehlitz, as structural engineer, and Paul Redden, as both owner’s
representative and contractor. The project did not need an architect. An architect’s role might have
included aesthetic decisions or maintaining accessibility and egress.
Kick-Off Meeting
A successful project needs a kick-off meeting. This meeting clearly defines the scope of the project and
the responsibilities of each team member. Responsibilities could include deliverables at specific due
dates or expectations for communication throughout the project. This project was defined as the
structural impact of installing an overhead crane in the Simpson Strong-Tie Building. The crane should
access the first six bays of the bottom floor and need not extend outside of the building perimeter. It
was agreed the final deliverable would be a set of calculations created by Amy Poehlitz. The calculation
would form part of a proposal by the Construction Management Department to the Cal Poly Facilities
Department. Communication between the engineer and owner-contractor would mainly occur through
weekly status reports. There would be weekly meeting between the engineer and her advisor.

Poehlitz 5

Project Priorities

Figure 1: The Three Project Priorities
At the start of a project, it is important to define the client’s priorities so the team knows what to focus
on. A project can only optimize two of the three priorities:




Time
Cost
Quality

For example, a project can have a short timeline and low cost but the deliverable won’t be good quality.
On this project, time and quality were priorities. Time was required because the project had to be
finished in a quarter. Quality was required because the calculations were going to be used for the
internal Cal Poly approval process. In an actual firm, the project would have had a premium on the price
because the high likelihood of additional work to stay on schedule. The additional work is often finding
alternative ways to get information that another team member is behind schedule in providing. For
example, in this project the crane vender had not delivered their quote and I needed the load
information to evaluate the existing structure. To stay on schedule, I sized all the crane members to get
a load estimate. If the project had a longer timeline I could have waited for the quote and saved the
extra work. For more information on the process of estimating loading see the Estimating New Loading
in Projects with Strict Deadline subsection in New Loading.
Communication
Methods of communication are as varied as projects. This project used weekly status reports for the
majority of project communication. Status reports are used in different forms in many different
industries. For this project, the reports included:




A summary of any meetings that occurred that week
Action items for each team member
Progress on action items from the previous weeks

Meeting notes are valuable to update team members not at the meeting and to act as reference
material for meeting attendees. The action items provide discrete goals that can be updated on a weekly

Poehlitz 6

basis. The flexibility lets the goals reflect the actual progress of the project, compared to the rigid overall
schedule.
The weekly status reports were also used in place of RFI (Request for Information) procedures. RFIs are
a set procedure used for information transfer between team members. RFIs were not used due to the
size of the project. In large projects, RFIs offer a way to organize the large and varied amounts of
information shared. In a small project, like this, a less formal system is sufficient and the exchange of
information happens weekly, either in meetings or over email.
For more information on RFIs:

Mar. 2016. Web. 14 June 2017.

Scheduling
Scheduling is designed keep a project on track, by making agreed deliverable dates for all to see.
Reverse scheduling is often useful for projects with hard deadlines. A reverse schedule is created
working backward from the completion date instead of forward from the present. It is recommended to
include flux time in the schedule to allow the project to recover from unforeseen complications.
Reverse scheduling was used for this project because the deadline of the end of the academic quarter
could not be moved.
Schedules for projects are dependent on actions of all team members.





Reverse Scheduling: used with a deadline that cannot be moved
Information Based Scheduling: individual discipline progress is dependent on the results of other
disciplines (team members). This type of scheduling benefits from the use of a facilitator. This
facilitator is commonly seen as a construction manager (as opposed to construction contractor).
Goal Based Scheduling: benefits of meeting short terms goals are used as the basis for
deadlines. For example, seasonal changes can affect a project.

The above list of methods of forming a schedule has not been vetted, but is the experience of the
advisor.
Often, one team member needs another member’s task to be completed before they can start their
own. For example, the architect might need information from the client. Instead of declaring a hard
deadline, the architect can ask if it works with the owner’s schedule. This allows gives the owner
flexibility. Another approach is to communicate why the information is needed quickly. Often, the owner
is invested in completing the project on schedule.

Structural Analysis
Working within an existing building brings additional challenges. Significant amounts of time go into
verifying the existing structure before the design can begin. The structural analysis process for additions
is outlined through the following steps:
Structural Analysis Process for Additions






Verify Existing Conditions (discussed on page 8)
o Structural Members
o Connections
o Loading Conditions
Estimate of Existing Capacity (page 11)
New Loading and Loading Location on Existing Structural Elements (page 12)
o Estimating New Loading in Projects with Strict Deadlines
If above conditions positive, than final design (page 15)
o Check of Existing Structure’s Capacity
o Design of Connection between Existing Structure and Addition
If above negative structure is not a good candidate for proposed addition/remodel

Poehlitz 8

Verification of Existing Conditions
The existing state of a building needs to be understood before the effect of any additions can be
analyzed. This process includes determining the existing structural members, how those members are
connected, and what loading is placed on the members.
This section compares the existing conditions in the Simpson Strong-Tie Building to as-built drawings
obtained from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo dated February 2011. The plans
were obtained through Cal Poly’s construction drawing archive, Web-Planroom. The existing building
has a timber framed roof (heavy timber joists and glulam beams) supported on pre-engineered lumber
parallam columns. These columns are supported on a concrete wall which rests on a continuous spread
footing. The interior of the building can be seen in figure 2.

Roof Member Sizes:
Sizes of the roof members were inspected visibly and appeared in accordance with the as-built plans.
The exposed nature of the roof made it easy to inspect the structure.
Connections:
The connections were also inspected visibly and appeared to match the details in the as-built drawings.

Figure 3: Drafted Detail and Existing Connection

Poehlitz 9

Roof Loading:
The use of the roof has not changed so a live load of 20psf for maintenance is still appropriate.
The general notes state the building was designed for a total roof loading of 20psf in areas without the
green roof and 32 psf in areas with the green roof. The green roof was never installed. The layers of the
roof could not be verified by inspection but it could be confirmed there is wood decking as the base
layer and PVC roofing as the top layer. It is reasonable to assume the roof was constructed as shown in
the details in figure 4. Based on the as-built drawings, a take-off of the roof might include:
80 mil PVC Roofing
Rigid Insulation
5/8” Plywood Roof
Sheathing

Sprinklers

Figure 4: Roof Construction Details
Based on the details in Figure 4, a dead load of 20psf is reasonable. The dead load calculation does not
consider is the weight of the skylights. These loads will be applied separately.

Poehlitz 10

An interesting loading condition on the roof is the presence of personal safety restraints (see figure 5).
These are hooks that maintenance workers can use while on the roof to attach themselves and hang
from the building. These loads transfer directly to the glulam beams.

Figure 5: Personal Safety Restraints
Drainage also needed to be considered when determining existing loads on the roof. If ponding occurs,
the weight of the water can quickly become significant. The Simpson Strong Tie Building does not have a
problem with debris build up, as there are no nearby overhanging trees to deposit debris on the surface.
However, after rain there is a small amount of pooling near the down sprouts (see Figure 6).

Figure 6: Pooling Near Drain Pipes

Figure 7: Extent of Pooling Relative to Roof Area

The water is not deep and the nets protecting the down sprouts seem clear of debris, which limits the
possible depth of puddling. The sitting water is a result of the roof sloping slightly toward the edge of
the roof instead of in toward the drainpipes. The puddling only occurs near the downspouts and only
within the gutter channels on the edge of the roof. The limited extent of the pooling can be seen in
Figure 7 on the next page. The loading effect of these puddles will be neglected because their shallow
depth and narrow extent results in limited impact on the capacity of the structural members.

Poehlitz 11

Estimate Existing Capacity
Often there are multiple ways that an addition can be attached to an existing structure. To decide which
option to investigate, start by estimating whether the structure has the capacity for each option. This
will reduce the time spent pursuing options that will not work. After the options have been reduced to
only those that are plausible the final selection should be based on other factors. These factors will vary
from project to project but may include minimal impact to the structural system, minimal impact to
usable space, and least cost. If after further investigation the first option is unworkable, the other
options can be returned to.

Figure 8: Possible Methods for Attaching Overhead Crane to Structures
The addition for this project was an overhead crane. There are several ways to add an overhead crane to
a building as shown in figure 8:




attaching the crane runways to the columns
installing separate columns (stanchions) that would support the crane completely apart from
the existing structure
attaching the runways to the roof

A quick calculation shown on page 31 in Appendix E showed the existing columns did not have the
capacity for the eccentric loading in option one. The separate frame is possible but not preferred as it
would take up floor space and require foundation work. Therefore, this report investigates installing a
crane to the roof beams. For this option, the ability to support a crane is dependent on the capacity of
the existing structure.

Poehlitz 12

New Loading
Once the general approach to installing the addition has been defined, the impact on the structure
needs to be quantified. Often, the impact is a load in a critical location. If the location of the addition is
flexible the placement should consider the existing building systems, such as MEP and structural. The
ideal location has the minimum impact on the existing systems. For example, the Simpson Strong-Tie
building has fire sprinklers installed above where the crane members will be installed. To minimize
interference with water coverage, the runways should be placed directly below the first row of
sprinklers as shown in figure 9. By placing the beams directly below the sprinklers, the umbrella water
sprinkling effect will be minimally impacted.

Figure 9: Approximate Location of Crane Members: Runways in Green, Bridge Girder in Blue
Estimating New Loading in Projects with Strict Deadlines
Sometimes tasks in projects are discipline dependent. For example, in this project the new loading could
not be fully defined until the quote came in from the crane vender. In projects with longer or more
flexible deadlines a delay may have minimal effect. However, this project needed to stay on schedule
and meet a hard deadline. Luckily, if information is delayed the situation is often not hopeless, but does
require unscheduled or uncompensated effort. Often, the information can be found an alternative way.
In this case load information was needed. To increase accuracy, loads can be based on a similar existing
condition. For more information on how this effects the project’s cost see the Project Priorities
subsection in Project Management.
As mentioned, on this project the crane quote was delayed and analysis of the existing structure needed
to begin for the project to stay on schedule. To estimate the load I needed to size the crane members, a
task that would also be completed by the crane vender. To keep the numbers realistic, the design was
based off an existing crane, the overhead crane in Cal Poly’s High Bay Laboratory, shown in figure 10.
The most important value from the existing crane was the deflection criterion. The deflection criterion

Poehlitz 13

for cranes is stricter than the code value because any slope in the beam affects the crane’s ability to
function. The actual deflection of the crane was found and divided by the span to give a deflection
criterion of Δ < l/586, four times stricter than the applicable IBC code value. The criterion is still
reasonable, it agrees with the masonry code criteria of l/600, per TMS 402-13 Section 5.2.1.4.1. The
masonry code limits deflection to mitigate cracking. The deflection criterion from the existing crane was
used while sizing the crane members. The crane members were sized for bending, shear, and deflection.

Figure 10: Overhead Crane in High Bay Laboratory
Shortly after the loads had been calculated, the quote came through from the vender. The estimate was
only 60% of the load given by the vender (crane quote in Appendix D). The estimated structure was
lighter because a deeper member was chosen for the bridge girder that was more efficient for bending.
The vender may have chosen a different, heavier section to limit torsional concerns or to maintain
ceiling heights. The difference in values illustrates why designs using estimates should be conservative
to limit redesign.
Influence Lines in Sizing Crane Members
The demand placed on members comes from the loading. In this case, determining the loading was
complicated by the crane’s ability to change positions. Each position is a distinct loading condition. To
capture all these conditions, the analysis utilized influence lines. Influence lines show how a reaction or
internal force at a specific location changes as a load moves across the structure. For example, an
influence line for the moment at the center of the beam, as shown in figure 11, gives the value of the
moment in that specific spot for each possible location of the load. This means there could be many
different moment influence lines for the same beam. In comparison, moment diagrams give the
moment at every different location on the beam for a single load configuration. Influence lines are not
the same as considering the increase in forces from the dynamic effects of the crane’s movements. The
dynamic effects were neglected in this project because the crane has a limiter on its speed to lessen
those effects.

Poehlitz 14

Figure 11: Influence Lines for Bridge Girder
In this project, the moving load was the crane housing and hoist, applied on the bridge girder. Influence
lines were found for the moment at the center, the shear at the end, the deflection, and the reactions at
the ends. The maximum values from the shear, moment and deflection influence lines were used to size
the bridge girder (see figure 11). The vertical reactions were also found and used to load the glulam
beams. The influence lines for bending, shear, and the vertical reactions were found using the MüllerBreslau Principle (explanation in Appendix C). The influence line for displacement was found using
Maxwell’s Reciprocal Displacement (explanation in Appendix C).

Poehlitz 15

Final Design
Once all the work has been done to define the existing structure and new loading the design can be
finalized. This includes the final check of the building’s capacity as well as any connections that need to
be designed between the addition and the existing structure.
Check of Existing Structure’s Capacity
To check the existing capacity, follow the load flow through structure and check the capacity of each
member affected by addition. For each member check shear, moment, and deflection. The capacity of
any connections also needs to be checked.
The crane load enters the structure on the glulam beams. The crane loading is expressed as a function
instead of a discrete value because of the movement of the hoist (functions in figure 11). Two loading
cases were considered to capture the extremes of the functions, shown in figure 12: the entire load on
one hanger and the load split between both hangers. The beam is symmetric so the concentrated load
only needs to be considered on one side.

Figure 12: Crane Load Cases on Glulam Beam
The analysis of the beam was furthered complicated by the tapered cross-section. The taper means the
moment of inertia changes along the length of the beam. To capture the change, the moment of inertia
needs to be expressed as a function in the deflection equation. To avoid an unnecessary complex
integration, the deflection of the beam was found by computer structural analysis software (ETABS).
The tapered cross-section also complicated the bending capacity check. Bending was checked using
stress. However, the equation to relate moment to bending stress is dependent on the height of the
section and the moment of inertia, both which change in tapered cross-sections. Therefore, the place of
highest moment, in this case the center of the beam, might not be the location of highest stress. A
spreadsheet was made (in Microsoft Excel) that calculated the section properties at increments along
the beam. The bending stress was checked at each increment. The graph shown in figure 13 illustrates
how the stress changes along the beam. The peak stress occurs approximately twelve feet from the end

Poehlitz 16

of the beam, not at the center where maximum moment occurs. The uncertainty in the location of
maximum demand is why demand on changing cross-sections should be checked across the length of
the beam. The glulam beams had sufficient capacity in bending. The beam capacity calculations can be
found in Appendix E.

Figure 13: Bending Stress on Tapered Glulam Beams (load cases correspond with figure 12)
The glulam beams are connected to the columns by a bearing connection, shown in figure 14. The
governing capacity for this connection was the axial capacity of the parallel strand laminated column.
The column capacity governs and additional loading cannot be applied, such as future storage racks.
The axial capacity of the column was low because its large unbraced length makes it susceptible to
buckling. The column had just enough capacity to support the additional weight of the crane. The
existing capacity of the structure is governed by the axial capacity of the columns. The conclusion of the
analysis is the roof and columns have enough capacity to support the proposed crane. It is noted that
the columns were efficiently designed by the original engineer and the additional capacity is most likely
due to the green roof loading, which never built.
If the crane is installed, a green roof cannot be installed in the future.

Figure 14: Glulam Beam to Column Connection

Poehlitz 17

Design of Connection between Existing Structure and Addition
Once it has been determined that the structure can support the addition, the connection to the
structure can be designed. The following connection design is a suggestion and shows that a connection
is possible. A connection is dependent on the actual crane selected to be installed and the connection
needs to match the manufacturer’s specifications.
The only connection for this addition was between the runways and the glulam beams. The vender’s
quote only gave a vertical gravity load for the connection (see crane quote in Appendix D). If the
connection only took vertical load, it is unclear what would prevent the bridge girder and runways from
rotating. A connection needs to resist 2% of a member’s axial capacity along the member’s axis to
prevent the member from failing in torsion per AISC 318. To account for the uncertainty in the load flow,
two connections were designed, one that only resisted gravity load, shown as connection one in figure
15, and a connection that provides torsional resistance to the bridge girder, shown as connection two in
figure 15. The connection that provides torsional resistance is much wider than the connection only
resisting gravity. The lateral load resisted by connection two created a large moment because of the
eccentricity between the connection and the bridge girder. That moment is resisted by the couple
formed by two lines of the bolts. The connection had to be wide to reduce the forces on each line of
bolts to allowable levels.

Figure 15: Initial Connection Design

Poehlitz 18

The design of both connections was governed by the bearing of the bolts in the glulam beams. This was
expected because the loading was perpendicular to the grain; the direction timber is the weakest.
Connections in glulam beams under constant stress that load the beam perpendicular to the grain tend
to fail over time through the delamination of layers. The initial plan to prevent this was to install two lag
screws directly connecting the flange of the runways to the glulam beam, shown in figure 15. The lag
screws were sized to carry the entire unfactored gravity load as a backup system separate from the plate
connection. However, the failure area of the lag screws interfered with the through bolts. It was decided
that instead of adding a separate back up system, a system to prevent delamination should be included.
A strap was added on each side of the connection that passes around the entire perimeter of the glulam,
shown in figure 16. The strap will hold the layers of the glulam together, not allowing them to
delaminate. The strap will need to be sized to accommodate the swelling and shrinking of the wood
throughout seasonal humidity changes.

Figure 16: Final Connection Design
Again, the connection was designed to show the ability of the glulam beams to support the crane.
Connection redesign and sizing will likely be needed when the design is finalized.

Poehlitz 19

Conclusion
This report found the Simpson Strong-Tie building can support a 2-ton overhead crane. The report
specifically investigated hanging the crane from the glulam beams. The type of crane considered was a
two-ton hoist with the system specified by the vender, Dearborn Overhead Cranes (more information
can be found in the crane quote in Appendix D). More specifically, the existing structure can support a
hanger load of 7.8 kips, occurring four and a half feet away from the exterior wall on the glulam beams.
While not investigated, supporting the crane on a separate column (stanchion) is also a viable option;
however existing foundation coordination will have to be considered.
The capacity of the existing structure is governed by the axial capacity of the parallel strand laminated
columns. The columns were originally designed to support a green roof. The green roof was never
installed, creating enough extra capacity to allow the installation of the crane. After the installation of
the crane the columns will be at capacity and will not have the ability to support additional loads, from
either the load racks or any future additions including a green roof.
The connection design included in the report is suggested. It is mainly included to show the ability of the
beam to support the crane. Connection sizing and redesign will likely be needed for the chosen crane.
The steps outlined in the project management section were sufficient for this small project. The project
was completed on time. I gained experience working in an interdisciplinary team, especially on a project
on a short schedule.
Hopefully the calculation package will contribute to Cal Poly Facility’s approval for overhead crane
installation in the Simpson Strong-Tie building.

Appendix C – Explanation of Methods to Develop Influence Lines
Müller-Breslau Principle
The Müller-Breslau Principle states the influence line for an action is proportional to the displacement of
a structure where the action is replaced with a unit displacement or rotation. Reaction forces and
internal shears are replaced with unit displacements. Moment reactions and internal moments are
replaced with unit rotations. For example, the internal moment at the center of the beam in figure 16
was released and replaced by a unit rotation. The resulting displacement of the structure, shown in red,
is proportional to the influence line for the internal moment. The line is then scaled by solving a single
loading case.

Maxwell’s Reciprocal Displacement
This principle states that the displacement at point A resulting from a load at point B is the same as the
displacement at point B from that same load at point A. For example, if F B and FA from figure 17 were
equal than ΔAB and ΔBA would also be equivalent. To this principle to influence lines apply a load to the
center of the beam and solve for the displacements at every point on the beam. By Maxwell’s Reciprocal
Displacement the displacement at any location on the beam from the load at the middle is also the
displacement at the middle from the load at that location.

Load Testing Advisory
1) Current specifications regarding the load tests of Overhead Crane Systems
ANSI B30.11 requires the following;
11-2.2.2 Rated Load Test
(a) Prior to initial use, all new, extensively repaired, and altered equipment shall be tested and inspected by, or
under the direction of, an appointed or authorized person, and a written report should be furnished by such person,
confirming the load rating of the system. The load rating should no be more than 80% of the maximum load
sustained during the test.
OSHA 1910.179 Paragraph K2 states the following;
Rated load test.
Test loads shall not be more than 125% of the rated load unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer. The
test reports shall be placed on file where readily available to appointed personnel.

2) Definitions
Hoist
A machinery unit that is used for lifting and lowering a load.
Crane
A bridging structure that spans two or more runways and provides traversing motion.
Runway
The rails, beams, brackets and framework on which the crane operates.

3) Dearborn Overhead Crane Load Testing Offer
(Maximum crane capacity of 10 ton or less)
It therefore is our opinion, that it is the owner’s responsibility to load test the overhead bridge crane system. The
"system" consists of the hoist, crane, runways, columns and footings. To test the "system", requires that the full
system be in place and therefore must occur after the completion of the crane installation. Although it is hoist
industry practice to load test every hoist prior to shipping, this practice does not preclude the requirement for the
full load testing upon commissioning of the full hoist, crane and runway system.
As a service to our customers, DOC offers to provide this load test free of charge to the purchaser of a Dearborn
Crane. To take advantage of this free offer, ALL the following criteria is required.
1. Dearborn Must be contracted to install the crane and will perform this load test during the normal installation
time period
2. The customer must provide a full capacity test load** to be used for testing purposes. This load must be
125% of the rated capacity of the crane.
3. The load must be of reliable weight, and be easily accessible and in the immediate area of the crane to be
tested. The weight of the load should be certifiable. If certification of the load is not practical, DOC can
provide a scale to weigh the load for a small fee.
4. All necessary rigging** must be provided by the customer.
5. The load and rigging must be provided while DOC is on site for the installation. (If the customer cannot
provide the required materials during the normal installation period, but still would like to have a Certified
Load Test performed, a crew can be provided on a time and material basis.)
Upon completion of the test, a temporary hand written certificate will be supplied to the owner, so that there is no
possible exposure to the owner of not have proper documentation. The official Load Test Certificate to following
within 2 weeks. Also, a copy will remain on file at Dearborn.
** Dearborn Overhead Crane is not responsible for any damage that may occur to either the test weights or the rigging used.

Gravity Load Flow – Roof
Load is distributed by the sheathing and 3x decking onto 6x10 Purlins spaced at four feet. These purlins
are supported by 6 3/4”x20” taperd glulam beams spaced at 12 feet, which in turn rest on 7”x7” Parallam
PSL columns. These columns are supported by a concrete wall which sits atop a continuous spread
footing.
Lateral Load Flow - Roof
The lateral loads on the roof are transferred through the sheathing and 3x decking into the rim beams. The
rim beams collects the load into the heavy timber braced frames on the exterior of the building. The
braces transfer the load into the concrete shear walls which connect to the foundation. The foundation
passes the load into the ground.

Top or Bottom Plate Connection

• Tables are based on:
- Solid, one-piece column members used in dry-service conditions
- Bracing in both directions at column ends
- NDS®
- Simple columns with axial loads only. For side loads or other combined bending
and axial loads, see the NDS®
• Allowable loads have been adjusted to accommodate the worst case of the
following eccentric conditions:¼ of column thickness (first dimension) or¼ of
column width.
• Beams and columns must remain straight to within 5L¼sos (in.) of true alignment.
Lis the unrestrained length of the member in feet.

Two 16d (0.162" x 3½") nails for
every l¾" of column width, nailed
through the plate into the column

For column allowable design stresses see page 5.
