Dieses Baums Blatt, der von Osten
Meinem Garten anvertraut,
Giebt geheimen Sinn zu kosten,
Wie’s den Wissenden erbaut,

In my garden’s care and favour
From the East this tree’s leaf shows
Secret sense for us to savour
And uplifts the one who knows.

Ist es Ein lebendig Wesen,
Das sich in sich selbst getrennt?
Sind es zwei, die sich erlesen,
Daß man sie als Eines kennt?

Is it but one being single
Which as same itself divides?
Are there two which choose to mingle
So that each as one now hides?

Solche Frage zu erwidern,
Fand ich wohl den rechten Sinn,
Fühlst du nicht an meinen Liedern,
Daß ich Eins und doppelt bin?

As the answer to such question
I have found a sense that’s true:
Is it not my songs’ suggestion
That I’m one and also two?
Gingo Biloba

Overall Design

Design Considerations

The overall concept for
this outdoor concrete
shell structure, located
in Furstliche Park in
Inzigkofen,
Germany,
is derived from an
abstracted ginkgo leaf.
Drawing on inspiration
from a poem about the
two parts of the ginkgo
leaf
becoming
one,
we took the approach
of
combining
both
the natural and built
environment into one
cohesive piece.

To connect the two, it
was imperative that we
place the shell on the site
as to have the smallest
impact. With a small
portion of the overall site
used, the unoccupied
space further enhances
the natural environment.
Creating a literal design
connection between the
land and water, one of
the four allowed legs falls
within the Danube River.

The purpose of the
structure is to highlight
the surrounding views
and landscape through
the use of large openings.
Providing direct sight
lines to both the forest
and a historical carving,
each side of the shell
provides a frame to the
outside world. To further
this experience, the
entrance of the structure
is low, blocking one’s line
of sight until they enter
the space.
Choosing to design the
structure with an overall
max height close to the
river, visitors transition
from nature to the built
environment while also
experiencing the “lifting”
of the shell, contributing
to a lightweight feel. The
oculus is also placed at
the peak of the structure
to further minimize the
presence of the shell,
opening it up to the sky.

03

Detail | Oculus

Detail | Lighting

The
oculus
design
for the structure is a
further abstraction of
the overall form. Taking
into consideration the
large openings on the
sides of the shell, the
oculus is meant to act
as a way point, drawing
the viewer into the
space and towards the
river. Along with this, the
oculus shadow moves
throughout the day,
highlighting the views of
the site as they become
illuminated.
In an attempt to link the
ground and the sky, the
edge of the oculus is
chamfered, creating a
sharp edge frame. This
edge condition blurs the
distance between the
built structure and what
is in view, flattening the
sense of space. The
top edge is offset as to
hide the connection and
provide a smooth corner.

04

During the day, the
main light source is the
sun. Asides from being
lit throughout most
of the day, the oculus,
as mentioned before,
creates an experience
for the visitors as the
light moves through the
space.

Lighting Section

At night, the main light
source exists under the
river, shining up through
the water and onto the
surface of the structure.
This lighting technique
will project the water’s
movement and shadow
onto
the
concrete.
Casting a texture onto
an otherwise smooth
surface will create a
dynamic
relationship
between the structure
and its surroundings.
With the use of only one
light source, users will
be drawn to the water’s
edge and away from the
dark.

Study Model Process
To begin modeling the
shell structure, we used
two tripods (an exercise
done with GeoGebra)
with one similar strut,
creating a four-legged
funicular structure. With
the computer program
at our disposal, we
attempted to create a
“quadpod”,
however
the method was not
working and this model
demonstrates a free
hand attempt.
The second model was
created with the idea of
two tripods combined.
Using the computer
model,
analyzed
to
be funicular, we were
able to measure the
length of each segment
and assemble using
basswood. We then
paper-mached a wire
mesh form on top of
the tripods, however it
was hard to match the
supporting structure.

Tripod Model

Hanging Cloth Model

Moving
away
from
the
tripod
analysis,
we chose to create a
hanging cloth model
instead. The concept
behind this model is that
a cloth, when hung, is
experiencing only tensile
forces. When “frozen”
in place and flipped,
the fabric becomes
a compression only
structure. To achieve
this, we dipped the cloth
in plaster as it was hung.

Digitzed Model

Once we had a working
model, the challenge
became
transitioning
from a physical to a
digital model. It was
important to carry over
the exact model as we
proved it was funicular
in its physical form. To
do so, we used a 3d
digitizer tool, which
creates a series of
points along the surface
of the physical model and
imports them to rhino.

07

Shell Analysis

SAP Analysis
Transitioning from the
hanging cloth model to
a rhino model, SAP was
used to confirm that the
shell was both funicular
(compression only) and
capable of withstanding
forces. Upon analysis,
the shell was found to
have an area of tensile
forces, however this is
due to inaccuracies in
the digitizing process
and was not seen as an
issue.

The primary method of
thrust containment for all
three land connections is
a spread footing with
an angled top surface at
each point on contact.
This slope will allow the
foundation to better
receive the struts coming
in at an angle. The blocks
on land are hidden
underground as to not
disturb the simplistic and
natural feel of the shell.
The foundation in the
river will be visible as the
water level fluctuates.
With this in mind, the
connection between the
shell and footing is made
seamless, following the
curve of the shell. This
sculptural footing blurs
the line between support
and structure, however it
is designed to become
a pile once it hits the
riverbed, counteracting
the poor soil conditions
of the river.

Construction Precedents
The first precedent study
done to legitimize the
full scale construction
process was the LAM
Pavilion in Lille, France.
Although this structure is
not a concrete shell, this
project was chosen to
demonstrate the amount
of customization within
inflatable structures. This
structure in particular
spans about 100 feet
and the interior of the
material is inflated.
The second precedent
study was focused on
finding a real life example
of inflatable formwork.
Binishells is a company
which specializes in
custom inflatables used
in creating formwork.
With a variety of systems
used for construction,
this method allows for
unique concrete forms
with minimal overall
material needed to form
the structure.

Given the isolated and
dense nature of the
project’s site, the ability
to transport standard
construction materials is
limited. With an access
point located 400 feet
way, it is important to
consider the feasibility
of construction. With an
emphasis on low impact
and material usage, the
decision to use inflatable
formwork was made.
In terms of large scale
construction
process,
the formwork for the
footings would be built
first, with an edge beam
placed between. This
beam would serve an
anchoring point for the
inflatable form. Once
sealed and connected,
the form would be
inflated, making sure
to keep a constant air
pressure. Once inflated,
the desired form is made
using Shotcrete.

Shell Realization

Prototyping
The main goal of the
prototyping
process
was to create quick
and simple models that
highlighted the positive
and negative effects of
using certain materials
and methods to create
an inflatable. Listed
below are the takeaways from the series of
models which led to the
final construction.

In order to ensure that
the inflatable takes the
desired shape of our
shell, we needed to cut
a piece of plastic to the
exact flattened shape
of the form. To do this,
we used a tool in Rhino
called UnrollSrf which
takes a 3d form and
instead of projecting
it onto a flat surface, it
“unrolls” the surface into
a flat 3d shape, taking
into account the length
needed for curvature.

Once
the
unrolled
surface was printed,
traced, and cut out of
painters tarp, the next
step was to create the
side pieces. For an easier
attachment,
although
the overall shape of the
side pieces has no real
effect on the final form,
the side curves were
traced from the top form
and extended. With the
pieces cut, the top form
was then ironed to the
base at all 4 legs. From
there the side pieces
were ironed to the main
form. To create an air
tight system, we poured
Slime into the form to
plug any holes.
Once inflated, using the
bike nozzle and an air
compressor, we were able
to attach “guides” made
of weatherstripping and
cardboard. To attach the
shell to the frame we
created 2x4 supports.

Reflection
This quarter introduced us to different ways of designing and analyzing a compressive, funicular, thin shell
concrete structure. Our project brief asked for a low impact concrete shell structure located in a natural area
in Germany that limited our design to four points of contact to the ground, a challenge that differed from our
peers. We began with mathematical models, which served as an initial design method, but through different
study models found that the hanging cloth model produced the best design and the most funicular shape
as well. It produced the best results in terms of form, as well as structural analysis while consistent with our
initial design concept. Our challenge came when it came time to decide the best method to construct the shell.
There were arguments between the group between a common construction method and a construction
method that was unknown and lacked enough precedents, but proven to be feasible. Ultimately, we decided
on pursuing the challenge of creating an inflatable formwork with the risk that it may fail. We had one week
to research and create the formwork. After multiple prototypes and models, we successfully ironed together
painter’s tarp with tape and cardboard reinforcement to create our custom inflatable formwork. We were
able to maintain a constant air pressure to keep the formwork inflated, poured the concrete, and removed
the formwork after seven days of curing. The project proved to have been worth the hard work and effort
in the end. Our group was able to demonstrate that inflatable formwork was more than achievable, it was
efficient in the time it took to construct and remove the formwork, and also produced a smooth interior
surface in our shell.
Although there were challenges in our design and construction process within the group, as well as outside
the group, the final results proved the obstacles to have been worth the effort. We were able to produce
results that most of our peers did not expect and rid them of their skepticism. Looking back, there were
a few things we could have done that may have helped us in this project. If we had decided earlier in the
quarter to build an inflatable formwork, we might have had more research, time, and practice to produce
better results. We might also have been better prepared with the supplies and tools we needed, as we
constantly improvised on what materials might have worked best. We hope that challenging ourselves to
pursue something outside of our comfort zone will serve as an example to future students who wish to
explore inflatable formworks or those who wish to approach a problem different from everyone else.
