# knnMajorPredictor
Uses senior projects to train a knn classifier to determine the major of the student who wrote the report.

## Work Log
Eric LaBouve:
- Collected test and training data for aerospace and architectural entingeering.
- Wrote the following functions inside generateVectors.py: getTfVectors, generateTrainingVectors, generateTestingVectors, and generateVectors.
- Wrote the following functions inside knn.py: getIntersection, euclideanDistance, and computeKnn.
- Wrote the cross validation code inside main.py
- Made slides 1 - 7 on the presentation.

Jason Chin:
- Collected test and training data for liberal arts, materials, and mechanical engineering.
- Implemented the Matrix class and all methods inside agglomerative.py.
- Refactored the design of the code: separated the main function into its own file, moved functions around to make more logical sense.

Minjie Fang:
- Collected test and training data for bioresource & agricultural, computer, electrical, and industrial & manufacturing engineering.
- Implemented the initial knn algorithm in knn.py.
